Award new maps as a heavy way to monetize progress. 

Maps are good for people that don't care about cosmetics, but want something more in game.

This applies to both paying and non paying customers, as the customers who grind will also have a chance to unlock new maps
through updates.

Also when you play in multiplayer, the player who has the unlocked map can share this with their friends. This will raise the
player's status, and make purchasing or ad grinding more desirable.

How much for an unlocked map? While cosmetic items might be like in Crossy Road, $.99 each, a map is going to be pricier.
Study other games for this to determine an averge fair price.

Perhaps in the beginning we will only have a few maps. But we can always design more later.

Each map will have a style, perhaps a different coordination, or some sort of playable bonus, which will only affect players
who have the map, and not affect players who do not have the map, so they will less likely be bothered by the pay to play model.
