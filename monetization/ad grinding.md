Ad grinding will be the most common way to make money.

This is a good way of generating revenue because players who will not spend any money, might still spend time on watching the ads,
which will generate revenue. 

Find ways to make ad grinding appealing. 

Crossy Road had simple ad grinding for getting coins. (Which you can exchange for characters?)

So don't stress from the point that we have to have a perfect in game mechanism, when the Crossy Road mechanism is so simple,
and yet worked.

Instead focus energy on research and implementation.
