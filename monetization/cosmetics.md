Lots of customization will help show off between whales in multiplayer.

Crossy road had 50 characters, and their game was just single player.

Have at least 50 accessories. Still determine whether to charge for each instance of an accessory, or not. 

If we don't, then there will be ample grind time for watching ads, and also the item will feel more special.

Check the max limit for watching ads per day. Might be 10 per day.

Determine some sort of formula of how many ads the user will watch, and how much we will reward per watch, adding up to 
total gold, which can then be used to buy an accessory. Do some simple math with Crossy Road, if we can apply coins in that game
for purchasing in game characters.

Give the player a few gifts as they progress. Also do the thing from "Let's go Whaling" where the first purchase is made easier,
look up the details.


# Hats

There is a brand new nice hats asset on the asset store

# Hair

TurboSquid has lots of nice hair that would work well.

# Clothes

Clothes will be the hardest to implement. Perhaps can model some t-shirts, and easy clothes at first, or find some models,
which we can mess around with in Blender.

If clothes are too hard, we can still do like a tie or something, and a necklace to also offer something for females. 

# Jewelry

Watches, rings, necklases, and earings.
