The optimal solution is to offer both chances to pay to play, and also just free play, so players who don't play can have continous flow playing the game for fun, while not be bothered, or minimally bothered by pay to play mechanics, and also capture the whales for the chances to pay to play.


Going over the document, "Let's Go Whaling", the author mentions that only 1% is sold by hats.

This goes against what Crossy Road did.

But perhaps that is different because they were selling you characters.

In any case keep offering the cosmetic, but since he mentions that progress is the main one, perhaps there is some way of
giving out progress for money, that is not entirely pay to play. So perhaps the player can purchase gold, which can then be used
to unlock further levels, while other players have to beat the AI on hard to unlock a level, or to receive those coins. They can 
also pay coins to get those levels.

What are other ways of giving out progress for gold?

The other thing about unlocking a map for gold required, is that players will grind for that by watching ads, with even a much higher chance than cosmetic items, if they are not intersted in those. So they watch ads, get gold, save gold to unlock another map. Perhaps new maps also have unlockable buildings. This would all count toward progress. Eventually all players will get tired of playing on one map, and they will want to unlock another map. Make each unlock more difficult. So for the second unlock require x gold, for the third unlock x * 2 gold, and so on.

Perhaps these new maps could be procedurally generated.

Crossy Road had 50 unlockable characters, so need something on that magnitude. Those players that were grinding for 24 hours, that must have been to unlock those characters, because there is no other purpose to the game, other than an infinite runner.


Afterwards when the players are maxed out, can no longer sell progress, but consumables. Faster healing times, and faster
build times seem so cheap. Not sure how to get around this. Study clash of clans.


Offer gifts so players can gift each other (reciprocity) and increase sells of cosmetic stuff.


One solution to pay to play would be to make the core game free, and then perhaps the higher levels are pay to play, where we unlock new items. Need something that will make whales spend money on cosumables (can we even make this work?) and progress without bothering the others that the game is pay to play and effect reviews negatively.



Torulf Jernstrom - “Let’s Go Whaling”

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZaN_GZPk2VOUafBq88A0OcxsaY5zDEaJvkHjJkjiu04/edit


A lot of spending comes from high paying guys “whales”
The very best way is to get two rich competitive guys to fight each other and tell them I’ll give you a slight upside to pay me
The best way both your retention and monetization is to ensure you have enough of an ingame economy, at least 1K, top grossing games have 10s of Ks in game economy, 100% of top grossing games do this, how you can keep lots of people in there, things to do, stuff to upgrade, to progress along, can give a huge discount on something, this is worth $150, but now i can give this to you for $5, if less than $5 then you can’t do this
Monetization by Bartle Type (Will Lutton)
Convenience (Achievers) -> progress (want to progress)
Sell convenience, faster progress (most sales will be here)
Customization (Socializers) (want to speak to other people)
Sell hats and stuff
Only single digit percent of income
Competitive Advantage (Killers) (want to compete)
Pay to win
Can go overboard, and have an unbalanced game
If too clearly pay to win people will stop playing
Content (Explorers) (are after stories and want to explore)
Content
Takes a lot of resources and time
Hardly any team can keep up the pace to create content
Monetization by Stage (Dmitri Dramanov, Fair Games)
Hook (Ice Breaker)
Give a really really good deal, something that’s a no brainer, would be crazy to turn down
The reason to give a really good deal up front, by making people spend on front they are emotionally committing to your game, retention will go up
First spend breaks the ice, will think of themselves as spenders, “okay to spend for me”, breaks the wall of “I will never pay for a mobile game”, so need to break this wall first
Habit (Progress)
Main meat -> where you sell the progress tokens
Hobby (Consumable)
Where the players are maxed out, have all of the Clash of Clans buildings at max level, can no longer sale progress but consumables
This is where you are selling the faster healing times, or faster build times of armies
Unlimited upper spend, no limit to how much you can spend in Clash of Clans
Gachas
Named after Japanese slot machines that give you collective stuff
On random you get collectible stuff (like collectible playing cards on Magic the Gathering, no matter how much you spend can’t get the card directly, but get random cards), have to over and over get new random packs
Great for monetization and retention because people like the lottery part
(Skinner Boxes)
A lot more exciting, and give more content, because they cannot immediately to progress, takes 5 times, rather than buying soft currency
Volume vs LTV (how to get to your millions)
Volume: Candy Crush, go for high volume and small percent of spenders
LTV: Mobile Strike: hardcore game, 95% will wonder, but the 5% that do play will spend a lot
Know where you stand on this
Hot State
Excellent book: “Thinking Fast and Slow”
Fast thinking: is what you want “Bread and…”
Slow thinking: analytical brain
Too much to ask of a spender
Make stuff immediately useful
Immediate gratification
Sell some boosters up front, coin doubler, people will analyze and think of this through, they will not do that, instead like in Temple Run, once game is over, save me, i have a few seconds to spend hard currency, similar in Candy Crush saga at moment lost, pay a bit more and can pass, make immediately useful
Loss Aversion
People are a lot more attached to the stuff they have, then an unequal amount of stuff that they can gain
Flip a coin: if tails take a hundred dollars from you, if heads, give you 120 dollars, no one will take the bet, need more gain to offset the loss, which is felt much more strongly
Need 200 gain against 100 loss, then we will take the deal
In games we can apply this by giving people stuff that they feel is in their pocket, and then threaten to take away unless they pay up, lots of level based games do this, lots of collectibles you get along the way in things like Puzzles and Dragons, if you don’t finish the level they will take away, now pay to continue a bit
Offers & Scarcity
Rare cards, goblins going with his clock tick tock card, “I’ll take this away from you” scarce will go away, brilliant way to get people to spend more
Subscription
Builder from Clash of Clans
Point is the builder has a very specific way of working, if you spend hard currency on this guy, will only get benefit from coming back to the game often, drives both retention and monetization, build stuff, that makes people come up to your game a lot to get the value out of that
IKEA Effect
Stuff that we put work into we value more
IKEA sells you cardboard shit
Still value slightly higher because we build ourselves
“Hooked” book, how to build hooking products, diagram on how we build habits
Trigger
Remind us to do something
Action
Variable Reward (Lottery ticket) 
Get from action
Investment
To really hook down, ask people to do a little bit of work
Then they will become emotionally attached
And then set up the next trigger, internal or external
External: notification
Internal: people have in their minds, started building that tower, or planted pumpkins, means need to come back in eight hours
Go round and round and then have the habit
Anchoring
When we don’t know the price of stuff, the first price we hear suggested, becomes anchor and we compare everything to that
Iconic example: Black Pearls, when first came on the market no one wanted them, didn’t look nice
The guy who had them said dump the price and get rid of them, the person didn’t understand hiked the price, and suddenly they became these objects of desire
If you ask someone to write down the last two digits of phone number, and then ask to bid, just because wrote down high number in paper will anchor thinking
How to use in game: tutorial will suggest to buy this IAP for $50, that will be expensive, then come back a few sessions later, and then they suggest to buy $15, and that will be a good value because anchor will be at $50
Social Proof
Especially when people are similar
You should have the socially expected behavior way in your game, which is paying
When a clan member spends iAP money, you want all the clan people to know, since this is the social expected way to act
Do not want to ever tell people that the majority of them don’t spend money
Availability
Stuff we hear a lot about, we judge as stuff to likely to happen
Can tie to Gachas, if rare not every player will see them
Which means they won’t think that’s not likely to happen
If they get one of those, should broadcast to clan members that they got the rare or legendary thing
The Right Amount of Choice
Put up a bunch of jams (20)
Less people bought
Get anxious, too much choice, buy nothing
Hide Control group which only had 5 jams to taste
A lot more people bought because that’s the best one
If there are 20 there is too much choice
Whales Take Longer to Convert
Data says whales take longer to convert
Have content for a very long time, 8 days, 12 days, 20 days
Core Loop Through the Store
Racing game example
Core Loop: Action and then into meta game where you do upgrades, Store
So loop always go through the store where you are spending money
Labeling Technique
If we tell people they are a certain way, complement them as being nice good citizens, they will more likely behave as nice good citizens
Tell people that they are generous individuals who have a taste for good art, and want to support their game developers by paying you
Spend Because… (Reasons)
Telling people the reason to do something makes them much more likely to actually follow through and do that, spend because “reasons” reasons don’t even have to be that good for this to work
Games of Progression
4 ways to progress
Skill
Luck
Grind
Pay
Make sure players understand that Grind & Pay are legitimate options / reasons of progressing through the game
Make sure that the games are not too skill based
Author made that mistake themselves
Too skill based don’t get people to pay you, because there is no reason to
Reciprocity is a very strong mechanic
If you give something to me, I feel obliged to give something to you
To trigger that we need 3 different criteria
Gift needs to be unexpected, personal, and significant, can’t feel like something that you gave to everyone (especially in clan based games), makes this a real challenge, but can incentivize players to trigger reciprocity between each other (so from game to player, and player to player)

Getting inside the heads of F2P players who pay $50 per month




What makes whales stick? 
Non payers (59% spend nothing)
Payers
Superwhales ($50 per month)



How to people find game, get stuck, and how to bring more people


How do whales find games?

How do find favorite games?

The most interesting takeaway, we talk a lot about app stores, but when we start looking at other sources, social word mouth, drives discovery, can’t be measured, organic word of mouth

Just as important as the app store


Different segmentation

When people start to spend money, online word of mouth facebook, twitter, use these sources much more frequently

Heavy payers much more likely to use Facebook invites, and Twitter posts

Whales really really like videos for game discovery

How many games provided video sharing opportunity, or a let’s play video? Essential, drives behaviour

Websites and press, blogs matter for heavy spenders, specialist press for gamers on mobile

They like discovering games through online word of mouth, much more important than for non payers

They will share on facebook, youtube, twitter, very big differential between non payer behaviour

Study how to achieve online virality


Reviewers, or authorities on YouTube

Youtbuve, facebook video, twitter video, seeing is believing, they are influenced by video

Two online sources standout: facebook, and youtube

Get in touch with let’s players who have large channels

Funny or interesting games


Youtube has new paid advertising for mobile

Engagement
Why do whales play the games they play?
Competitive play
Being able to watch others playings, texting
Fundamentally, whales are more interested in getting involved in social features, which help retention
Want to engage with other people
Next question: how do you feel about these type of features, leaderboards are surprisingly important, feel like an outdated feature, but seems like super whales like leaderboards
Making in game friends, socially interacting
Specific features
Making new in game friends
Sharing resources with in game friends, coordinating with them
Looking for experiences beyond tapping on the screen, challenges, looking to get involved, other people are super exciting, unpredictable, messy, unpredictable
Providing clan system, can buddy up with existing friends, playing together or playing against someone
Free to play game, with whales, social is key driver to people
GAme communities
Are not what you do in the game, but what you do around the game
In a community setup, trying to find out what type of community features matter
In game communities are something that gets added on top, or around, doesn’t detract from experience, but don’t make the game either, a forum added doesn’t make a bad game to a good game, but provides an outlet where people can meet up
Spice on the mix, let’s people come together and interact, and explore the game outside of the game, and maybe create their own life
Should people use real identity?
Real friends want to use real name
Anything else, if you want to go with a once choice, go with a unique avatar, problem with a facebook identity, don’t want to be known as yourself, facebook is a challenge set up on mobile
So somehow invite through facebook but have a unique avatar
Competitive play stands out, clear driver to show off, and make people want to get new in game friends, make them, and challenge them
We all seem to be roughly social people

If you get a whale in…

They get engaged, how do they bring in more people?
Word of mouth is the most important method of discovery, and most important way is sharing
With phone can immediately share what the phone is about, connect with someone and demo
Think about how can rapidly show the fun, the x factor of a game, clearly this seems to be the number one way of sharing
5% do live broadcasting of mobile gameplay, big number
Not a surprise that people who are super engaged in games, will talk about them, and share them, people don’t just start paying, you have to hook them, if they do they are much more into gaming
What’s really interesting is that the behaviour to spend, are much more likely to share
So invested, sharing comes naturally

A less popular method of sharing (Whales really stand out here)

Tips or tricks
Watching footage
Discussing games on forum

15% of spends live broadcast of their game, have to airplay from pc to mac, pull out video recording, and then connect that to twitch, and if 10%+ do that, perhaps should advertise on Twitch, or go on Twitch and check who is live broadcasting mobile game play, and start marketing to those people directly


Heavy spenders are very likely to discover games on Youtube, video sharing goes hand in hand with watching, super interested going to forums, these people don’t care about obstacles in their game

Check that cat game, and go through all the people that post footage, and then check other mobile games to track down social media presenters

Whats App, Skype is very popular

Facebook rules, and YouTube is second


One take away from this whole presentation is VIDEO and YOUTUBE


Why do people want to share?

Motivation: creativity really matters, as long as there is the need to bring other people in, creativity is something that people are really motivated by, learned something interesting, want to show other people, people are proud of creativity and having a solution to a problem

Another reason to share: to become part of a community

How important is the social aspect of sharing


Whales are social, this is a big takeaway, takeaway the notion of a lonely dude in the basement who is spending money, or someone who is psychologically ill who cannot connect with people, word is derived from casino world where these people are somehow special

The more you spend money, the more you share, the more you want to be social and connect with other people

(leaderboards, avatars, clans, etc, study)


When you share you want to be an authority of someone who is recognized for helping people, and being a show off.

Tools that let you show off is something you want to bake in your game

People are also invetsed in building, mastering techniques, and

Facilitate in game visiting, let’s the compare to others

Creativity across the board is big, but also helping people, sharing, and being recognized for contributions and 

Feed the need to be recognized, and create an outlet for creativity

How to make whales happy

In game community for retaining players

Provide tools for easy sharing

Never seen anyone talk about how YouTube matters, but YouTube matters a lot

If you are into upgrading and showing off, video is very important for that

#1 mistake to drive whales away

Runnning out of something interesting

When you start paying, make a commitment, whales are actually very logical, research from Ubisoft, why is spending happening, rational spending decisions, to create more powerful ways to 

When you run out of interesting things, they will stop playing, but you never run out of people and clans, PVP systems, they are infinite resources, if you have other people to compete against, you will never run out of interesting things





 Monetization of Candy Crush


Candy Crush Saga is extremely approachable visually, with cute characters, bright colours and satisfying fanfare. If makes the game extremely approachable for anyone.


Alright, so I said I wouldn’t mention game design so I’ll keep this short. Candy Crush is a game built with its monetization and social system integrated into its core experience; not the other way around. So many freemium games today are designed in a backwards way of either:

A) Creating a game and then trying to push in a Freemium strategy as an afterthought
B) Having a monetization strategy and trying to build a game around it.

That’s right, the game contains the dreaded Zynga life model… But that’s okay. It is a system that works and keeps the game fresh by restricting/limiting gameplay sessions. This system helps increase engagement, reduces burn-out and gameplay fatigue. While the game only offers 5 lives initially, it is usually more than enough to pass by time on that short subway or bus ride.

The life model also feeds into the other monetization and social systems of the game. A player can both send and request more lives from friends or can simply refill the life meter for a mere 99 cents.

ocial Checkpoints
The game offers 35 levels before gating the player with a social checkpoint. What’s a social checkpoint you ask? The social checkpoint is another mechanic that has a multi-tiered function. It covers multiple aspects of retention, conversion and attempts to increase daily/monthly active users. I will cover more aspects of the social checkpoint in later sections.

But for now I’ll just highlight the mechanic, it does 3 main things:

1. It gates the player from progressing further and gives them a goal – Unlock the next chapter!

2. If the player wants to overcome this obstacle immediately and keep playing, they can pay 0.99 cents

3. Alternatively a player can ask 3 friends to send them tickets to open the next chapter. The player will then have to wait for their friends to respond to continue on. There are another 2 points here that I should mention:

a. Sending ticket requests to existing friends performs a social callback (this is covered in more depth in the retention section). This encourages active players to come back more frequently.

b. There is a chance players will invite new friends to the game which would help increase the monthly active users count. New users mean new chances at having a customer that will convert.

The Impulse Purchase – I WAS SO CLOSE!

So you play candy crush… you’ll understand when I make the statement “Oh god I was so close! I would have beat this level if I had one more move….” This is usually followed by brief internal swearing. Well you can buy 5 more moves so you aren’t stuck on that pesky level for another 2 weeks.

This is easily the most monetized aspect of the game driving the majority of player conversion. Anyone who has played the game past the first 35 levels has surely run into this… multiple times. The impulse “5 Extra moves” purchase works hand in hand with the life system and more importantly the difficulty pacing of the game. When the player hits a difficulty spike, they can easily spend days or weeks trying to beat a level.

When they finally get close, get that surge of excitement and then fall short, it is much easier to convert them to continue playing.


Even the Menu is Built to Drive Player Conversion

Have you noticed that the continue button changes colour depending on the situation? On levels where the player’s fail state is to run out of moves (Clear Jelly, Drop the ingredients or Earn a certain score) the continue button “Play On” changes from its usual pink to green. This is a small change but it entices the player to press the button subconsciously. I know I have done this action more than a few times. Like I’ve mentioned in my past article, you can never underestimate the power of the human subconscious.

Consumable Power-Ups
Consumable power-ups can help offer an advantage over those difficult levels. These can be purchased right before pressing the Play button to enter gameplay. Consumables can count for up to 60% conversion in many games. Candy Crush offers all of its consumables into bundles of 3 for added value to the player. There are 3 main power-up bundles available for use on mobile:

Start the level with item x. Can match anything, or be combined with other things for even bigger effects.

Start the game with a Striped and Wrapped candy power-up. Wrapped candies detonate twice , destroying a 3 by 3 grid around them both times. Striped candies clear rows when matched.

Add powerful Coconut Wheels to the to the candy mix. Coconut Wheels move in a random direction and create power-up candies along the way.

Charms the Durable Whale items (Warning: For the hardcore Candy Crushers only)
Charms exist to greatly reduce the difficulty of the game. If a charm is purchased by a player, it will reduce the likelihood they will encounter some of the other conversion mechanics currently built in. In other words the player will have an easier time beating levels and they will encounter the life system, 5 extra moves option less frequently. With that in mind, Charm upgrades are priced at a high value.


Note: Pay to win is acceptable in a single player game. Don’t like it? Don’t pay.

The Charm of Life
Alright, you play a lot. You are totally invested in this game. You are the Lord or Lady of crushing poor innocent candy. But wait, 5 lives just isn’t enough to carry on your candy smashing madness? Maybe you want to get more lives in that life pool? No problem!
You can purchase a charm to give you more lives permanently in your life pool. This charm is aptly named: The Charm of Life. It increases your life pool from 5 to 8.

Cost: $16.99


Charm of Stripes
 Once a game, change any candy to a striped power-up candy. Match it to clear a row, or combine it with other special candies for even better effects. Why is this charm so expensive? It’s better than 5 extra moves and can make clearing levels a breeze.

Cost: $39.99


The Charm of Frozen Time
Any time based level you play, the time doesn’t count down while you look at which gems to match. This charm negates essentially the most difficult aspect of timed Candy Crush levels.

Cost: $16.99



Retention Systems

Bite-sized Gameplay
Candy Crush levels are short, typically between 30 seconds to 2 minutes long. It’s bite sized gameplay that you can indulge in even in the smallest windows of boredom.

Story Lite
There is actually a story in Candy Crush and while it’s not going to be winning literary rewards any time soon; it is important to note that there is one. Basically the story is as follows: A little girl is travelling through a land of candy. As she does, she encounters and assists its denizens along the way.

It’s not much and it isn’t compelling but it gives the player another progression goal: Discover the rest of the story.

Progression and Goal-oriented Play
There is always some challenge to overcome or something new to achieve. The player is constantly driving forward. This constant progression brings the player back to the game almost impulsively.
Some of the goal-oriented play is as follows:

• Beat a level
• Beat “that frustrating” level
• Get 3 Stars in a level
• Beat a chapter
• Unlock a new chapter
• Get 3 Stars in all the levels of a chapter
• Beat a friends high score
• Catch their friends on the map

And so on… Candy Crush is a progressive endless game which can be scaled easily.

The Map
The map plays an important psychological role for the player. It gives the player a better sense of their progress. Where have they been? Where are the going? Where are their friends?
Social integration into the map also breaths in a small competitive spirit amongst friends as you can see exactly where they are and what levels they are currently stuck on. It makes you feel good passing a level with ease that your friend has been stuck on for 2 weeks.


Difficulty Pacing reduces Player Burnout
Another game design note. At its core Candy Crush is built around its difficulty pacing. Those oh-so-frustratingly difficult levels are immediately followed up with usually 5-6 easy to medium difficulty levels. This peak and valley difficulty pacing keeps players engaged and coming back. A sense of accomplishment is a primary driver of progression and player retention.
Overburdening the player with too many difficult levels in a row drives retention down.

Complete and Utter Social Integration
If your friends are playing, you’ll likely be playing. Simple as that. Candy Crush has integrated Facebook into almost every facet of its design:

• Friends scores are displayed on every level.
• Facebook profile pics of your friends litter the world map with their latest progress
• Social upgrades and power-ups galore to be sent to and from your friends
• Gifted lives so you can keep playing
• Social Checkpoints give your friends added value


It goes on, but needless to say: Gameplay is improved with your friends. Also another great thing to note is that Facebook integration is seamless and very smooth. The player does not even need to leave the app to receive or send Facebook requests. This seamless integration ensures maximum engagement. By keeping the player in the game, the designer ensures that the player cannot get distracted by their social media. In other words, not leaving the game keeps the player around to invest more time and possibly spend more money.

Social Callbacks
Players can brag, send consumable power-ups and help their friends unlock new chapters. Side note: I hope you like Facebook alerts. Your friends will repeatedly drag you back into the game to help them (or help you). Even if you quit Candy Crush, your friends will bring you back in there to help them and hey, once you’re there, why not crush some candies. Annnnd you’re back.

Social Checkpoint – 3 Game Challenge
Social Checkpoints at their core, give the player a goal. Unlock the next chapter.

So I mentioned social checkpoints and their evolution from the horrible pay wall. But don’t get me wrong, social checkpoints have flaws as well – they still drive player engagement and retention down. If the player waits too long for tickets from a friend and don’t want to pay the 99 cents, they are likely to abandon the game.

To address this, King.com recently added in the ability for the player to “Play to Progress”. The player is offered the opportunity once a day, for three days, to beat a simple challenge. Once the third challenge is overcome the next chapter is unlocked. This mechanic helps solve some retention issues with social checkpoints.

The Sweet Sweet Summary
I know I’ve missed a fair bit but as you can see Candy Crush Saga is a deceptively simple design with many layers of thought and consideration put into every aspect of its game design, social and monetization systems.
The game monetizes so much yet it still manages to find that sweet balance between fun gameplay and monetary conversion. So what do you think? Does Candy Crush offer enough sweet gameplay without needing a trip to the dentist?


Even with the monetization everywhere you can still play without paying (almost) anything up till... oh, I think level ~60, where I got bored and uninstalled it. I paid $0.99 to pass the level 35 wall because it was less annoying than using Facebook, and I thought the game was worth at least a dollar. And it sounds like the new Play to Progress would remove even that. So they've done a good job in making sure it's not /required/ to pay to win even though it's available everywhere if you're impatient. Sometimes levels take a couple tries that way, but it also means you get some satisfaction of out beating them.

I must say I almost stopped playing when you 'earn' your first powerup but you can't actually use it without paying. That crossed the line to sleazy, but it didn't do anything worse than that.


@Aaron: It's not sleazy because of the payment factor - I paid for the extra levels (and I would easily have paid $10 for the game flat out to not have to put up will all the social and F2P bulls@$# and constant nagging - they would have gotten a lot more money from /me/ that way, but I know I'm not the audience). I was being mostly complimentary there, that the game is so well designed that you /don't/ have to pay to win, though it's always tempting you.

Candy Crush went sleazy there because the game had me 'earn' a power up then said 'Wow! Golly Gee! Here's an awesome shiny new powerup you just earned! Dang, isn't this just the coolest thing?' I agreed: 'Yeah, that's pretty cool.' Then Candy Crush said 'Wow! Golly Gee! I'm so glad you agree! Now to actually use it you have to pay real money. Tee hee hee!' That was the only time I felt scammed. Even though the game is free, winning something sets up certain play expectations. It's like getting a lottery scam in the mail. Otherwise it was very clear and up front about the spending.


My main point was: Candy Crush Saga, like any other successful F2P game, isn't one that you "Win." There will always be more endless activities to do, otherwise they wouldn't be maximizing revenue on the game's biggest fans.

"Pay To Win" means you pay money for an advantage in gameplay vs. not paying, and this game is chock full of that.


Some good articles on game economies: https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/RaminShokrizade/914048/




This iteration of Candy Crush introduces new candies and mechanics, yet it’s intuitive enough for first-time players to enjoy.

For mobile games, the first 10 minutes is critical for user retention. During this time period, users are going through tutorials and learning how the game works. If the game isn’t immediately fun and intuitive, players might just move on to something else.

Therefore, good engagement is essential for delivering a game that people love. A clean, simple, and intuitive user experience helps newbies get hooked on your game as soon as they boot it up.


https://medium.com/googleplaydev/why-the-first-ten-minutes-is-crucial-if-you-want-to-keep-players-coming-back-to-your-mobile-game-4a89031b6308


For starters, the game’s title screen presents a call to action for both new and returning users. This is a good decision, because many “first-time” users to Jelly Saga won’t be first-time users to Candy Crush in general. This way, there’s no worry that players will have to start from scratch and re-add their friends.

Of course, logging in through Facebook is useful for retention too. This helps users keep track of their scores and connect with their social network. There are many examples of apps that have increased retention by encouraging social logins.


https://developers.facebook.com/success-stories/lifesum

Interestingly, the game doesn’t force new users to create an account. It’s possible to jump straight into the first level and play on your local device. However, if you open the settings, you can set a username, avatar, and email address. This means tying your game progress to an online account and syncing it to any other devices you might have.

It’s generally beneficial to get users to sign up for an account. For instance, if you have access to a player’s email address, you can send re-engagement messages or offer discounts to bring them back to the game.

But, there’s a catch — you may not want to force players to sign up before experiencing the game. Forced signups mean the user must commit to the game before even knowing what it’s about. App developers frequently recommend a “try before you buy” approach, giving users the option to skip account creation until later in the lifecycle.

One Thing To Improve
It’s good that creating an account isn’t mandatory, but the app could do a better job of prompting users to create an account and input their email address. For example, the UX team could make the settings button jiggle or glow, indicating that the user is missing profile information. Another option is to wait until the user’s second play session before showing an in-app prompt that asks for registration. These are relatively non-obtrusive ways to get new users to sign up without interrupting their first-time experience.

Alternatively, in-line with the “try before you buy” approach, Candy Crush Jelly Saga could wait until a day after the player’s first session and send a push notification asking them to come back to the game, register, and take advantage of capabilities — like syncing across devices.


The gameplay is the core of Candy Crush’s app experience. The app does a good job of explaining the rules of the game, in case it isn’t immediately obvious.

The first few levels don’t explain any of the complex mechanics — they just tell you the basic rules and let you experiment. Later on, the game explains how the other mechanics work via in-app messages.


By and large, this works well because it gets players into the game without overloading them with information.

Additionally, if you get lost and can’t find a match, the game will give you a hint, Candy Crush provides players with hints in case they get stuck, like the wiggling squares below.


Finally, each level ends with seeing how you stack up on the leaderboards. Your score is compared against a group of other players. The game doesn’t tell you where this list is pulled from — it could be a random selection of players, or perhaps based on location. In either case, it provides some incentive to retry the level and get a higher score.

Of course, the incentive is stronger if you connect your Facebook account and compare your score against friends. Not only does the leaderboard encourage users to integrate their account, but it gives them another reason to keep playing and competing, driving them a little deeper into the mobile engagement funnel.

One Thing To Improve
While it’s helpful that the game doesn’t overload you with information at the start, this can be confusing in its own way. The game doesn’t tell you how the more complex candies work, but they still work — meaning that you see the effects of certain candies without understanding what you’re doing.

This is most noticeable during the end-of-level bonus, which occurs without any user input. It seems to be an important part of the game, but it’s not explained within the first 10 levels.

The game could benefit from providing more in-app messages to explain the game mechanics. If these messages are too obtrusive, the app team could perhaps create a separate menu for instructions.


Monetization & Re-Engagement
What Candy Crush Does Well
Monetization is one of the biggest challenges for free apps. The app team must somehow convert their player base into paying customers, even though the base game is free. Furthermore, they need their players to keep coming back. Otherwise, they’ll be forced to pay the cost of acquisition to replace each person that churns.


https://www.statista.com/statistics/185736/mobile-app-average-user-acquisition-cost/

To turn candy into cash, Candy Crush turns to in-app purchases. The left screenshot is from the in-game store. You can buy a variety of items to get a higher score, replenish your health if you run out of moves, and more. These items aren’t necessary at first, but come in handy once you reach later levels of the game. When the difficulty ramps up, players have more incentive to buy items.

As a monetization tactic, in-app purchases prove especially effective. Candy Crush made waves in 2015 for making $1.3 billion in one year. More recently, researchers learned that in-app purchases account for $2.8 billion of all purchases made through Apple’s app store. But most of those purchases are made by 1 percent of users. So Candy Crush tries to appeal to a wider base by offering discounts.

When I tapped the purchase button, I received a discount (the screenshot on the right). There are other discounts built into the app that trigger at various times — making it more and more enticing to splurge on an in-app purchase.

https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn-leanplum-images/1/2019/02/Screenshot_20190104-175027_Candy_Crush_Jelly.png

These are a couple more retention mechanics used in the game. We have the Rank system (left) and Daily Bonuses (right). Your Rank increases as you play the game and achieve a higher score on past levels, while Daily Bonuses are rewarded — you guessed it — every day. It’s an incentive to play the game a little bit every day.

Both mechanics increase the player’s drive to progress and keep them returning to the app in the long run.


One Thing To Improve
When I first downloaded the app, I played roughly 10 levels and then stopped. After two weeks, I received only one push notification, shown below.


This is a great push notification because it gives the player a reason to return to the game — and it’s even written from the perspective of an in-game character.

However, there’s room to go even further with this. If a dormant player doesn’t want to re-engage, you can send a push notification offering free in-game items or a flash sale on in-app purchases to sweeten the deal. When you want to deliver that message, you can tweak your message timing to find the perfect frequency. This message was delivered almost a full two weeks after I downloaded the game; that’s quite a long break for a first-time player. A (more successful) re-engagement message could be sent sooner to new players that are at greater risk of churning.

To give your retention strategy greater life, set up an automated lifecycle campaign that reaches dormant users on a regular cadence for a set period of time. Try day one, day three, day seven, etc. — until players come back. The glory of automating a series of messages like this is you can “set it and forget it,” so you can focus on scheduled campaigns, while triggered or re-engagement campaigns continue to work for you in the background.

If push notifications aren’t an option because you don’t have push permissions, coordinate with email. Data shows that sending emails in combination with other channels — like push notifications — increases the average weekly number of sessions by 3x. The game gives players an incentive to input their email address; this can be used for re-engagement messaging as well.

Crushing the In-App Experience?
Does King crush the in-app experience with Candy Crush Jelly Saga? In many ways, the answer is yes. The game is easy and intuitive to play, and it’s filled to the brim with incentives to keep coming back day after day.

Overall, the main element of mobile engagement that could be improved is messaging. Instead of passively waiting for users to return, the app could better proactively ask for push notification permissions and send re-engagement messages. The app ecosystem is crowded, but no matter how many new games a user is trying out, setting up re-engagement campaigns will keep the app top of mind.

Success of Candy Crush can be credited to the usage of exceptionally well defined marketing and psychological strategies by the developers to make the game addictive.

The success of candy crush is a result of great mixture of marketing and psychological strategies. This use of psychological marketing has led to a candy crush addiction among its users and more money to the developers.

Just like other freemium apps, Candy crush can be downloaded and played free of cost. People are never forced to pay a penny to play the game. It has been designed in a way that free users too can finish the game but with certain restrictions like limited lives and moves. There are only in-app purchases for extra lives and moves. This free model worked really well for Kings as the users got time to try and to get addicted. This addiction led to more, recurring, and long lasting income.

Simple
The Game is really simple to play. Users just have to switch adjacent candies to form rows or columns of three of the same color, which get disappeared from the board. Fulfilling certain tasks will promote them to the next level.

This ‘simple’ game isn’t that ‘easy’ though. The difficulty level increases as you move ahead and due to the limited lives provided, users generate a want to play more.



Pay to Play More

Candy Crush is primarily monetized through the in app purchases. Users get a set amount of lives (5 lives) and moves to complete a level, exhausting which they have to buy extra lives/moves through the in app purchases. They can also opt for in app purchases to start new episodes.

These purchases can be substituted by sending requests to Facebook friends and hence users are not forced to pay at any stage.


Since the friends have to accept the request for the user to move ahead, it takes a lot of time. Hence, users prefer in app purchases to feed their addiction.

The in app purchase cost is kept very less and an average user have paid around $25 dollar. It’s the number of users that did miracles for the company.


Facebook
It all started with requests on Facebook.

One of the best strategies devised by Candy Crush Saga was the requests on Facebook. A user is asked to either pay or to send requests to their Facebook Friends to get extra lives / moves or to move on to a next episode. Facebook, with over 1.5 billion users, is a perfect platform to engage and gain more users for the application. It became the primary source of new users for the game in its initial stages.


Social
Gamers can see and compare their progress with their friends and family members. This social motivation has made many users shed their money to compete and win against them. Reaching on a high level on Candy Crush is something to be proud of, you don’t reach there easily. The social factor became a good strategy to earn more as people like to show off to people they know.


One of the most important factor behind the success of the game is its quality. Candy Crush, which looks a bit like bejewelled, used great graphics mixed with soothing music and most importantly – no glitches. The game maintained top quality by not including advertisements and having full control in the hands of the developers.

Positioning
It takes hardly 2-5 minutes to complete a turn on Candy Crush. This has helped the Brand position itself as a pass time and not just a fun mobile video game.

Number of Levels
There are currently more than 2000 levels in candy crush. Game become more difficult as the user levels up. It is certain, in this game of luck, that the user might get stuck in one or more of the levels. More challenging the levels are, more is the probability of user paying to get it cleared.

But Kings had to keep the difficulty moderate as many difficult levels might lead to users abandoning the game.

Use of Analytics
Candy Crush made good use of analytics to find out what makes their users to play more and what is stopping them. Level 65 was considered as one of the most difficult level and stopped users from playing ahead. This level was soon removed to make users stick and go deep in the game.

Other Marketing Strategies
Word of Mouth Marketing has been one of the biggest strategies behind the spread of this game worldwide. Candy Crush has also used influencer marketing and other strategies like cross promotions, TV advertisements, etc. to market its brand.


Colors
Candy Crush is a mixture of every color. Hence the game can be considered gender neutral and


Words
Use of words like delicious, sweet, etc. give short term motivation to the user and makes him play more.

Less lives
Majority of the candy crush game players haven’t paid a penny for extra moves. As a result, they get 5 lives to play and gets one extra life after every half an hour. Hence, they can’t play the game as much as you want in one sitting. This not getting enough of the game creates a desire to get more and this curiosity leads to addiction.

This strategy of limited lives is to counter a phenomenon called “hedonic adaptation” which refers to the fact that humans get used to nice things over time until they no longer anywhere near as pleasurable. Hence, people stick to this game for a long time without getting bored.



Game of luck (just like slot machines)
One of the major reasons people stick to Candy Crush is because of its unpredictability. Candy Crush cannot be conquered with a set of certain skills. Just like gambling, Candy Crush totally depends on luck. The arrangement of candies are totally random and no one can predict the result based on few moves. (We can replicate this with different worker abilities, and also later different buildings becoming available)

Psychology of gambling addiction can be applied to Candy Crush addiction as well.

Handy
The game can be played with one hand, doesn’t require an active internet connection (on smartphones) and doesn’t take much time to exhaust a life / level up. Hence, it can be played anytime and anywhere.

Fun Fact – Candy Crush has been played on Antarctica as well.

Never Ending
Candy Crush has released many new levels even after the previous levels being completed by the users. This has helped them in retaining users which would have otherwise deleted the game after completing all the levels.

5 best practices for rewarded video from Candy Crush maker King
June 26, 2018
By Alina Lacey-Varona

“If you create a great advertising experience for players, they’re going to want to engage with it,” says Melissa Stein, global vice president of ad product at King, makers of hit mobile game Candy Crush Saga. Though it’s a supplement to their multi billion dollar IAP revenue stream, King today monetizes some of its titles with rewarded video advertising.

 

In a recent webinar with the Mobile Marketing Association, Stein shared the inner workings behind how King thinks about integrating rewarded video ads and the fundamentals of creating a great ad experience. From this presentation, we selected five attributes that should be a fixture of every rewarded video integration.

1. Create a value exchange
In exchange for watching a rewarded video ad, the rewards offered need to actually help players advance and give them more time within the game. When players receive a reward, they are stronger, better, richer, faster, or have more resources to survive. Being the advertiser that leads the player to the rewards creates a positive brand association and the advertiser has more opportunity to continue to share more ads (and rewards) during gameplay.

2. Avoid overindulgence
Rewards need to help players achieve their objective in a game (e.g., complete a quest, advance to next level, win battles, etc.). Brand marketers need to ask themselves three things when deciding on the reward:

 

Is the trade-off meaningful for that player
Does the reward give the player something that they need at the right time
Are they getting enough value from the reward (i.e., don’t give a life when they have a full set of lives)
3. Keep gameplay sacred
When a player is out of moves, lives, energy, etc., this is when brands can swoop in with a rewarded video and be the hero. Until then, keep gameplay sacred and do not interfere with the flow of the game. Instead, be there with the extra boost they need to continue playing the game.


4. Include an exit strategy
Don’t force anyone to watch your ads. It’s a sentiment shared by many other leading mobile game developers, including Top Eleven maker Nordeus. The logic behind rewarded video is that players want to see the ad because it helps their gaming experience. If a player does not want to see your ad, then there needs to be an option for them to get out easily and continue playing.

5. Know your audience
Determine the timing of your rewarded video ad based on player type. King categorizes them as:

 

Expirementers. These are players looking for something new beyond the core loop experience (i.e., the base action or series of actions repeated throughout a game). They are highly engaged, making this a great opportunity for the advertiser to sponsor an experience outside the core loop (e.g., contests, treasure chests, quests).
Passive engagers. Busy people, who play during a break in the day. For this audience, you want to get ads to them early to maximize your advertising opportunities.
Routine consumers. Habitual in their play. For example, a half an hour a day, everyday, before going to bed. By knowing their playing habits, advertisers should max out their frequency cap during the course of play, as opposed to a 24-hour period.
Ad lovers. Players who strategically wait to engage with ads, knowing there’s a maximum allowable amount of ads they can watch in a day. Once they’re stuck at a certain point in the game they will tap into their reserves to view the ad and take advantage of that reward.


https://blog.fyber.com/how-nordeus-beat-ea-and-monetized-the-world-with-rewarded-ads/

What King’s best practices reinforce is that the approach to developing rewarded video ads should be audience (player) centered. Players acknowledge those advertisers which have taken into consideration how an ad and its placement will impact them by choosing to give their time and attention to that particular brand. In exchange, brands themselves will be rewarded with greater brand recall, message association, and purchase intent.

As a user experience designer for games, I keep a close watch on new trends and apps with cutting edge marketing and consumer psychology principles that free-to-play titles employ today for monetization & retention.

Selling match-3 boosters: how it’s done
Boosters are power-ups that most match-3 games sell to help player’s get through a level quickly when they are stuck, boosters can turn failures into victories and quicken player progression

As far as selling them is concerned, most games today use the good old “Try before you buy” approach, by giving free samples.

Standard practices in most games today is to gradually unlock new boosters by offering two to three free samples for players to try out and then start pushing for purchase.

Taking things a step further in Diamond Digger Saga

Step 1: Unlock new Boosters
Step 2: Teach people how to use
Step 3: Give 2 - 3 free samples

But this seems quite conventional? So, how is it better?

Giving samplers post-sampling
If players are not buying the boosters when they run out of free samples (post-tutorial), they need a reminder of the power and capability of boosters by whetting their appetite once again!

In a nutshell, Diamond Digger is routinely integrating powered/buffed down version (samplers) of it’s boosters in specially designed levels, post giving free samples.”

A sampler is a classic restaurant Promotion 101 tactic, where in small portion of a meal is free to whet a customer’s appetite. It primes them for purchase.

Diamond Digger, after giving away free samples (boosters that a player consumes quickly) in tutorials, often reminds players what these boosters can achieve by frequently giving them a taste of these bite-sized samplers (mini-boosters).

Still skeptic about the whole Sample vs. Sampler debate? Let’s see how King is reverse-engineering this in another match-3 game, Pet Rescue Saga.

Pet Rescue Saga: Sampler vs. Sampling
Pet Rescue Saga initially follows the same design as other match-3 games, wherein you can unlock boosters as you progress, you get a few to sample, and once you run out of those prompts, you have to buy them.


But this initial behavior changes over time.

As you progress deeper in the game, this failure screen prompts changes to accommodate new kind of boosters, ones that the player cannot equip upfront and are only available at failure screen.


Instead of buying +5 moves, above is what I have been receiving lately. You may ask, “What is the big deal? They just replaced “buy +5 moves” offer with a bunch of random boosters?” or “… Are they random? really?”

Look closely! These new boosters are powered-up versions (that players occasionally consume for free!)


It’s the same sampler approach as Diamond Digger! But instead of buffing down the booster power, it has been buffed up. I call this Booster Scaling Effect.

Between Diamond Digger Saga and Pet Rescue Saga, King is scaling the perceived value of it’s boosters at both ends, pushing default samplers in player’s path for consumption by designing specific levels that endorse power and abilities of their boosters in scaled sample sizes (up or down) priming them for purchase.

Studies also suggest a lot of match-3 players consider buying boosters cheating, sampler approach via pre-integrating bite sized boosters might make their use feel more natural.

As players get to see and use them more often, their resistance will naturally soften.


“Ask yourself … why scale or buff existing boosters? King could have simply used new boosters like a x instead of y but that would break the priming association.”

Conclusion
Reason for the above approach is unique because it is differentt from just giving free consumable samples from time to time, which most games do as part of “Try before you Buy” approach.
King is consciously tweaking level design to integrate bite size samplers and place them in players’ paths for consumption at a frequency much higher than giving free samples.
Unlike free samples, these samplers have a very strongly noticeable scaling effect in terms of buffs and visual design, which resonates with real world mental model of restaurant promotion.
Is it hugely effective? Difficult to comment without conclusive data, but it surely is different from what most developers out there are doing – and King seems to be running with it for now.

“My underlying question is, can this sampler/scaling effect be applied outside the realm of casual match-3 games?”


Question is, how to create these in game boosters that feel natural

But game publishers have been learning a new trick: gamers are willing to pay small amounts of money to extend their experience. You can largely thank Candy Crush, whose parent King Digital makes money from addicted gamers seeking to advance levels.

“Mobile games and the ensuing popularity of free-to-play (F2P) mechanics have shown traditional developers that some customers are willing to pay regularly for additional content,” Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. “We expect console game publishers will attempt to strike a balance between monetization tactics of F2P games and the conventional ‘$60-box-sale’ revenue model.”

Big Picture: One analyst says big videogame publishers are still “in the early innings” when it comes to in-game purchases.


been profitable since, a fact that analysts put down to its ability to persuade players to pay several times over to continue the same game. 

We talk internally about.. bite-sized entertainment, and we think that fits the mobile generation of today... short game rounds as opposed to having a super deep, long game," he said.

"Candies felt like something that everybody would have a positive feeling about.. And I wanted something that could have shine and glossiness without being something unattainable,"

the mobile success is what really took us by surprise," Knutsson said.

Players now have the option when they run out of play time to pay for more time, watch a video advertisement, or simply wait until they earn more for free. That’s also true for “Candy Crush Friends Saga,” released this week, which includes the ability to unlock cute costumes for the many characters now in the game.

“We’re not going to go into loot boxes,” Zacconi said. “Video advertising is a new area we are building out. We’re making sure you can continue to play as soon as the video is over and that it is relevant to the player.”

the perfect mobile game experience that doesn’t take much thinking or preparation, so I see why it’s such a success.

https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2014/apr/01/candy-crush-saga-app-brain

Both articles share my thoughts on the potentially addictive nature that King has pushed into their Candy Crush games. In Candy Crush Friends Saga, you’re slowly pulled in with easy levels that take nothing but a few mindless swipes to complete. You’re rewarded with large words like “Sweet!, “Divine”, and “Delicious!” popping up on the screen. If you complete a level, your remaining moves turn into power ups that cause excitement and havoc in front of you.

At the end of each level, you’re rewarded a score and ranked amongst your friends. If you don’t have any friends that play, King will give you fake friends to fight against instead. You are given this very mild sense of satisfaction. It’s not incredibly exciting, yet you find yourself swiping, swiping, swiping away and it’s hard to understand why.

King, the developers behind this, aren’t strangers to this phenomenon. It’s called gamification. It’s a technique used to make you feel good about playing their game. There doesn’t need to be any sense of skill or strategy involved. Instead, you’re slowly drip fed small dopamine hits that give just enough satisfaction to keep you playing. To keep you going for longer, they dangle more small rewards in front of you. In Candy Crush Friends Saga, this includes new characters to play as, new costumes, or big rewards for getting to the end of a trail of levels.

Now, if this was just a free game with no in-app purchases tied to it, you could argue that it’s all fine and dandy - just like any game, it’s down to the player’s responsibility to know when to put the game down. This is true, but King, and many other developers like them, slowly start to make winning less predictable and ultimately more difficult as you progress through their games. If you can’t complete a level, you’ll lose a life. Run out of too many lives in a short period, and you’re forced to wait or spend money to get more lives.

Alternatively, you can spend money to get extra power-ups to get past the levels with ease. The trouble with this whole system is that King expertly tie their gamification into their monetization. By this I mean they expect you to get mildly attached to the wins and rewards that get thrown your way, and then they just nudge them ever so slightly out of reach. And by ever so slightly, I really mean it. It’s as if the levels are designed to make you feel like if only you had one or two more moves, or another power-up, you’d be able to get past it.

This feeling incites frustration in the player and it spurs them to keep playing. In gambling it’s called a near miss, and many studies have been done on its effect on the brain. This study shows how the same near miss feeling in Candy Crush gives off a very similar effect. Even though there’s no money to be won, the same signs and signals are there to lull you into addiction.

There’s been lots of research on this and it’s why there are so many regulations on gambling in the first place. Yet, there are no regulations on casual games like Candy Crush. To me, the potential for addiction seems just as strong. Examples of players feeling a sense of regret for spending money on mobile games when they shouldn’t is well documented.


Gambling Near-Misses Enhance Motivation to Gamble and Recruit Win-Related Brain Circuitry

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5445157/


“Near-miss” events, where unsuccessful outcomes are proximal to the jackpot, increase gambling propensity and may be associated with the addictiveness of gambling, but little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms that underlie their potency. Using a simplified slot machine task, we measured behavioral and neural responses to gambling outcomes. Compared to “full-misses,” near-misses were experienced as less pleasant, but increased desire to play. This effect was restricted to trials where the subject had personal control over arranging their gamble. Near-miss outcomes recruited striatal and insula circuitry that also responded to monetary wins; in addition, near-miss-related activity in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex varied as a function of personal control. Insula activity to near-misses correlated with self-report ratings as well as a questionnaire measure of gambling propensity. These data indicate that near-misses invigorate gambling through the anomalous recruitment of reward circuitry, despite the objective lack of monetary reinforcement on these trials.

The second factor that was modeled in our task was personal control, which refers to the gambler's level of involvement in arranging their gamble. On games of pure chance like the lottery, craps, and roulette, gamblers have an equal chance of winning regardless of whether they, or another agent, places the gamble. However, it is repeatedly observed that gamblers have inflated confidence (indicated by wager size, for example) when given the opportunity to choose their lottery ticket or throw the dice or roulette ball themselves, compared to conditions where the action is performed by anothe

The Candy Crush Sweet Tooth: How ‘Near-misses’ in Candy Crush Increase Frustration, and the Urge to Continue Gameplay

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5445157/

Abstract
Like many gambling games, the exceedingly popular and lucrative smartphone game “Candy Crush” features near-miss outcomes. In slot machines, a near-miss involves getting two of the needed three high-paying symbols on the pay-line (i.e., just missing the big win). In Candy Crush, the game signals when you just miss getting to the next level by one or two moves. Because near-misses in gambling games have consistently been shown to invigorate play despite being frustrating outcomes, the goal of the present study was to examine whether such near-misses trigger increases in player arousal, frustration and urge to continue play in Candy Crush. Sixty avid Candy Crush players were recruited to play the game for 30 min while having their Heart Rate, Skin Conductance Level, subjective arousal, frustration and urge to play recorded for three types of outcomes: wins (where they level up), losses (where they don’t come close to levelling up), and near-misses (where they just miss levelling up). Near-misses were more arousing than losses as indexed by increased heart rate and greater subjective arousal. Near-misses were also subjectively rated as the most frustrating of all outcomes. Most importantly, of any type of outcome, near-misses triggered the most substantial urge to continue play. These findings suggest that near-misses in Candy Crush play a role in player commitment to the game, and may contribute to players playing longer than intended.

Introduction
Since the emergence of multimedia cellular phones in the mid-1990s, mobile phone gaming has claimed some degree of presence in our continuous, ‘on-the-go’ lifestyle. From the initial craze surrounding the game “Snake” on early Nokia devices, our mobile gaming habits have been transformed by the ever-expanding quality, sophistication and overall usage of smartphone technology. Of particular interest is the surging popularity of Candy Crush Saga—a free-to-play, candy themed puzzle game that has captivated at least 93 million daily active users in 2014, and generated $2.2 billion in profits (mostly from in-app purchases) in that same year (King Ltd 2015).

To play Candy Crush, players are allotted a fixed number of moves in which they can swap symbol positions with the goal of horizontally or vertically aligning three (or more) matching symbols. When matched symbols are aligned, points are awarded and the ‘captured’ matching symbols are removed from the game matrix (and replaced by other symbols). A single match constitutes one move. In each level of the game, the player must achieve a specific objective within a limited number of moves before the player can unlock the next level. The objectives can include bringing a certain number of ‘ingredient’ symbols to the bottom of the game matrix (in game play players are instructed to “Collect all 6 ingredients!”), or ‘freeing’ candy symbols encased in ‘gelatine’ or ‘jelly’ tiles (e.g. “Clear all the jellies!”). If the player meets the objective within the allotted number of moves they win, and move on to play the next level (colloquially known as “levelling up”). If they fail to meet the objective in the allotted number of moves they lose, and remain at the current level, which they must repeat if they wish to move on in the game.

Since games like Candy Crush are typically played on smartphones, they encompass a unique set of traits that distinguish them from console-type video games but intriguingly, bring them closer to the conceptual realm of slot machines. For example, like slot machines, smartphone games are easy to learn, and players are frequently reinforced as each successful move is accompanied by eye-catching animations of points being accrued as the aligned symbols are captured. Perhaps most importantly, play is continuous- there is always a next level to play (The Economist 2013). Although Candy Crush (like most phone games) lacks a direct gambling element in that no money is wagered on outcomes, money nevertheless can change hands. Players can, if they wish, purchase game currency that can be used to gain extra lives, extra moves or bonus accessories as a way to maximize their likelihood of winning and advancing in the game. Although less than 3 % of players end up making such transactions (Grubb 2014), the players who do, spend on average $23.42 per month on these micro-transactions (Grubb 2014).

The monetization of gaming through these micro-transactions blurs the dividing line separating regular video-gaming and gambling for money. In addition to the negative impact of excessive video-game play on overall social, physical and psychological well-being (Ferguson et al. 2011), some players can, and do spend more than they can afford on these games (Lloyd 2016).

Structural Similarities Between Casual Games and Gambling Games
Several speculations comparing the structural similarities of Candy Crush and slot machines have been made in attempt to explain why Candy Crush has such an ‘addictive’ quality (see Smith 2014; Gardner 2014). Tellingly, Candy Crush players often specifically liken Candy Crush to slot machine play to convey its appeal. They highlight the enticing animations that accompany successful moves, and levelling up (Smith 2014). Moreover, the fact that a correct move is characterized by the alignment of matching candies parallels the alignment of matching symbols on the pay-line in slot machines. Furthermore, players attempting to gather (or capture) candies may allude to the indirect consumption of these forms of foods—a pleasurable experience which many of us are motivated to repeat (Lowe and Butryn 2007; Gardner 2014). Such game themes where food symbols are paired with reward are evident in many slot machines. In fact, in the United Kingdome, slot machines are colloquially referred to as ‘fruit’ machines (Griffiths 1993).

The parallels between slot machine play and Candy Crush involve not only rewarding events (winning spins, levelling up), but also frustrating events. Near-misses are outcomes that come close to, but fall just short of a win (Reid 1986). In traditional 3-reel slot machine games, a classic near-miss is represented by two high paying symbols matching up on the first two reels, and a 3rd matching symbol stopping right before or just after the pay-line (“7-7-X”). Thus, the player falls just short of the big win. In Candy Crush, the program specifically highlights attempts that fall just short of the goal of levelling up. For example, if the player needed only 2 moves to level up, but ran out of the allotted number of moves they would see the move counter drop to zero, followed by a message claiming “Out of moves! You only needed 2 more jellies”. In contrast, if the player was not close to levelling up, the move counter would simply drop to zero and the message would simply state “out of moves”. As such there is a clear attempt to highlight to the player those instances where players came close to, but fell just short of the goal of the game. We refer to these outcomes as Candy Crush near-misses.

Although no studies have investigated the ramifications of Candy Crush near-misses, one can make reasonable inferences based on near-misses in other scenarios. In slot machine games, near-miss outcomes encourage the urge to continue play despite the absence of reward (Côté et al. 2003; Kassinove and Schare 2001; Clark et al. 2009; Billieux et al. 2012). In general, the idea of falling just short of a big win appears to facilitate players wanting to continue with the game in the belief that practice makes better, or more spins will eventually lead to success (Kassinove and Schare 2001).

Because a near-miss reflects a thwarted goal, it tends to provoke a negative emotional experience. While players rate slot machine wins as being pleasant, they rate near-misses as being unpleasant and more aversive than regular losses (Clark et al. 2009; Chase and Clark 2010). One means of capturing the rewarding property of wins and the aversive property of near-misses during actual play is by measuring a combination of Post-reinforcement Pauses (PRPs) and Skin Conductance Responses (SCRs). Post-reinforcement pauses are typically defined as the time it takes to initiate a new response after a specified reinforcement (Felton and Lyon 1966). In slot machine play, PRPs are operationalized as the time interval between the delivery of an outcome (e.g. win, loss, or near-miss) and the initiation of the next spin (Dixon et al. 2013; Dixon and Schreiber 2004; Delfabbro and Winefield 1999). After having participants play a slot machine, Dixon et al. (2013) found relatively long PRPs for winning outcomes compared to near-misses (and other standard losses). Players’ faster initiation of the next spin following a near-miss outcome was seen as an attempt to escape the unpleasantness of just missing the win (Dixon et al. 2013). Research measuring arousal (quantified by SCRs) complement this interpretation (Lobbestael et al. 2008; Civai et al. 2010). During slot machine play, wins trigger significantly larger arousal responses than losses, presumably due to their exciting properties. Near-misses, however also trigger large skin conductance responses than regular losses—a finding Dixon et al. (2011, 2013, 2015) attributed to their frustrating properties. In sum the combination of long PRPs and large SCRs was viewed as a signature of reward-induced arousal, whereas the combination of large SCRs but small PRPs was seen as a hallmark of frustration. Based on the slot machine literature, it is reasonable to surmise that near-misses in Candy Crush (just failing to level up by one, two or three moves) might induce similar frustration that could be operationalized by the combination of large elevations in skin conductance and short PRPs.

Near-misses influence players in different forms of gambling. For example, a recent study by Stange et al. (in press) investigated near-misses in scratch card play. Players uncovered a series of symbols hoping to find three matching symbols within a 3 × 2 symbol matrix. They compared losing outcomes (no matching symbols), winning outcomes (three $5 symbols leading to a small win) and near-miss outcomes (where only two of three “jackpot” symbols were uncovered and players “just missed” winning a large prize). In such a game, the outcomes are only known once the last symbol in a matrix is revealed. Stange et al. (in press) showed that during near-misses (compared to regular losses), as players successively revealed a first, then a second jackpot symbol their skin conductance levels (SCLs) increased presumably due to increases in arousal in anticipation of the big win. Elevations in Heart Rate (HR) also took place during near-misses as the first and second symbol were uncovered. They also found that subjective frustration ensued when players uncovered the last symbol and their hopes were dashed. We surmise that this anticipatory build up as players get closer and closer to their goal and the frustration encountered when they “just miss” achieving their goal may occur not only during scratch card play but also during Candy Crush gameplay. As players make more and more moves, they accrue points and get closer and closer to levelling up. When they run out of moves it is reasonable to assume that frustration will ensue.

To summarize, most current research on near-misses pertains to studies of gambling, limiting their application to the smartphone gaming context. Here we will examine how winning (levelling up), losing, and just failing to win (a near-miss) in Candy Crush affects players’ levels of physiological arousal (as indexed by HR and SCL), emotional reactions (as indexed by subjective ratings) and reward responses (indexed by PRPs). We hypothesize that near-miss outcomes will produce greater physiological arousal (higher HR and SCL) than full loss outcomes during the game. Here, following Stange et al. (in press), we will measure SCL changes that occur during the game as players get closer and closer to levelling up. We expect near-misses to trigger similar SCL changes to actual wins since the anticipatory build up period prior to winning or proximally winning should be comparable. Based on previous findings by Dixon et al. (2013), we hypothesize that players will produce longer PRPs following wins than either regular losses or near-misses. If indeed we see high arousal but small PRPs for near-misses (the aforementioned signature of frustration), we should also see greater subjective ratings of arousal and frustration for near-misses than for losses. Finally, consistent with gambling studies where near-misses trigger the urge to continue gambling, we predict that subjective ratings of urge to continue play will be stronger for near-misses compared to regular losses.

Methods
Participants
A total of 60 Candy Crush Saga players were recruited to participate from two pools of students at the University of Waterloo. The first pool consisted of students participating in studies advertised for extra credit in a psychology course of their choosing. Students in this pool were recruited through the University of Waterloo’s SONA system—a website that manages student participation in Psychology studies. Out of the 323 students from this pool who were eligible to participate, 39 participated. The second pool consisted of students who voluntarily enrolled in a pool to participate in experiments for financial remuneration. These students submitted their contact information to the department of Psychology to be included in a database accessed only by authorized researchers. A total of 141 students from this pool were contacted. Out of this number, 22 participants responded, and 21 participated. Students recruited from this pool were compensated $10 for their time.

Students from both pools were first asked to complete a pre-screen survey to ensure: (1) students reached at least level 70 in the Candy Crush Saga, and (2) students had played the Candy Crush Saga within the last 12 months. Assigning a cut off level of 70 in the Candy Crush Saga ensured that players were adequately experienced players.

The final results of the study are based on 57 students (48 female) between the ages of 18-24 (M = 21, SD = 1.43). Participants were excluded if they did not meet the aforementioned criteria or if there were issues in data collection (e.g. technical issues, etc.). Participants on average had achieved level 287 (ranging from 70 to 930). In terms of playing frequency, 23.8 % of players reported playing Candy Crush on a daily basis, 65.7 % reported that they played the game at least twice a week, and 10.5 % reporting that they rarely play.

The current study’s protocol was reviewed and approved by the University of Waterloo Research Ethics Committee. All participants were provided sufficient information about the study prior to participating, and were advised that they could withdraw at any point in the study without penalty.

Apparatus
Candy Crush Saga Game
Participants played a real, complete version of Candy Crush on an Android tablet device. A built-in video camera on a MacBook Pro laptop was used to capture the tablet screen as participants played the game. The tablet rested on a tilted platform aligned to the computer’s camera. The video was used to record the outcomes (pictured in Fig. 1) that were delivered during game play and mark the precise time of their delivery for data analysis.


Post-reinforcement Pause
Post-reinforcement pauses (PRPs) were defined as the delay between an outcome delivery in one game and the initiation of the next game, measured in seconds. In Candy Crush, a message at the end of each game appears. The messages associated with the three different outcomes are shown in Fig. 3. Players were instructed to press a button on a button box adjacent to the tablet when they were ready to answer a set of subjective surveys and play the next game. The post reinforcement pause for any given outcome was the total time delay between the appearance of the outcome message and when they pressed this button.


Materials
Pre-test Questionnaire
Prior to commencing the study, participants were asked to complete a brief questionnaire (using the Qualtrics survey system) composed of demographic information (age, gender), as well as their experience with the smartphone game (current Candy Crush level, playing frequency, and an estimate of the amount of time they allocated to the game).

Subjective Rating of Arousal
The Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM; Lang 1985) measure is a non-verbal, self-report tool used to measure one’s immediate experience of arousal. A single-item arousal scale was employed, with each item pictorially represented by a manikin displaying different degrees of arousal intensity (Fig. 4). Participants were asked to indicate their level of arousal by placing an ‘x’ under the corresponding picture immediately following the delivery of each game outcome that they experienced during the study.


Subjective Rating of Frustration
Subjective frustration was measured by having participants evaluate how much they agree/disagree with the statement “I feel frustrated” on a 7-point Likert scale after each game outcome was delivered. The scale ranged from 1 to 7, with 1 representing ‘Strongly Disagree’ and 7 representing ‘Strongly Agree’.

Subjective Ratings of Gaming Urge
Two items derived from The Gambling Urge Scale (GUS) measured urge to continue playing the game following each outcome experienced. These two items included “All I want to do is keep playing” and “I want to play so badly that I can almost feel it”, and were reworded to exclude gambling terminology. Participants were asked to rate their desire to continue playing using a 7-point Likert scale, with 1 indicating ‘Strongly Disagree’ and 7 indicating ‘Strongly Agree’. Both items of urge were summed (in accordance to scoring guidelines of the regular GUS), and averaged (i.e., all summed GUS scores for wins were averaged).

Design
The present study consisted of gameplay epochs and baseline epochs. During gameplay epochs each participant would play up to eight games of Candy Crush. During the eight games, players were expected to encounter all three possible outcome types, (wins, losses and near-misses). Players were instructed to play a ninth game if they did not experience all three outcome types within the initial eight games. Each outcome was demarcated by a specific message at a game’s end: a ‘sugar crush’ demarcated a win, an ‘out of moves’ message demarcated a regular loss, and a message unambiguously specifying how close the player was to a win (e.g. “You only needed two more jellies!”) demarcated a near-miss (refer to Fig. 3). An a priori decision was made to only consider as near-misses those outcomes whose proximity message indicated that they were three moves away or less.

Baseline epochs occurred: just prior to game play, after the player had completed four games, and after eight games had been completed.

Procedure
Participants were invited into the testing room and were first asked to complete a consent form, and the pre-test questionnaire. Following the completion of the questionnaire, the skin conductance electrodes and the pulse transducer were attached to their left hand and placed on a foam block.

Once the electrodes were attached, the experimenter provided the participant with verbal instructions for game play and baseline epochs. All participants started with an acclimatization period. They were given 3 min to play two easy practice games (level six and level seven in the Candy Crush Saga). This allowed the participant to adjust to playing the game with the electrodes attached to their left hand. Next was the first baseline task where participants completed a digitized rotary pursuit task on the tablet. They simply traced their finger over a dot moving in a circle. Following the baseline task, participants then played four games on the tablet device. To maximize the probability that participants would experience wins, losses and near-misses during gameplay, the researcher preselected game levels set at 15 levels below his or her personal best. Each of the four games took approximately 5 min to complete. Before initiating the gameplay epoch, participants were shown a button box placed beside the tablet (refer to Fig. 1). They were told to press the button when they wished to start gameplay, and to press the button once again when the game was over. Once players indicated that the game had ended (via a button press), they were administered the self-report items assessing subjective arousal, frustration, and urge to continue playing. This questionnaire was administered following each game. After answering questions related to the fourth game, a second baseline session (rotor pursuit task) was administered followed by four more games, followed by a final baseline epoch. The conditional ninth game followed the 3rd baseline epoch.

Results
Out of the 60 participants recruited, only 56 had valid data for all measures. Three participants were excluded because they did not experience all three game outcomes and one had a technical issue with the recording software. Participants ranged in their frequency of play from those who played very seldom to those who played multiple times per day. Most participants reported playing between 20 and 30 min in a game session. Frequency of play and reported session lengths are shown in Tables 1 and ​and22.

Data Reduction and Analysis Strategy
All measures were subject to outlier rejection analyses. Data points more than 3 standard deviations away from the mean were considered outliers. Heart rate was measured in Beats per Minute (BPM). To circumvent the fact that games could be of different temporal lengths we analyzed BPM and SCLs only for the last 30 s of each game (ending with the posting of one of the outcome delivery messages in Fig. 3), and the last 30 s of the baseline periods. Changes in SCL were measured by calculating the slope of SCLs over this 30-s epoch. For all measures, outcomes of the same type were averaged. For instance, if the player experienced four losses, two wins and two near misses, the data for each measure would be reduced to three numbers (e.g. there would be three arousal ratings comprised of the average for losses, the average for wins and the average near-misses). For data analyses involving baselines (HR and SCLs), there were four data points per participant- three data points related to game outcomes (average of wins, average of losses, average of near-misses) and one data point reflecting the average of the baselines. For HR, SCLs and PRPs, we conducted repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) involving all outcomes followed by Fisher’s Least Significant Difference (LSD) Comparisons. In instances where there were violations of sphericity, Greenhouse-Geisser corrections were applied.

For the subjective data we employ planned contrasts between near-misses and losses, wins and losses, and wins and near-misses for all of the subjective measures. Note main effects in an analyses of variance would be underpowered since for many measures no difference was predicted between two of the three means. For example, similarly high arousal should occur for wins and near-misses.

Physiological Measures
As shown in Fig. 5, the baseline condition was associated with the lowest heart rate. During game play, the 30 s leading up to either a win or a near-miss appeared to trigger relatively high heart rates, with losses triggering lower heart rates. A repeated measures ANOVA with a Greenhouse-Geisser correction revealed a significant main effect of condition, F(2.427, 133.50) = 18.75, p < .001, η 2 = .25. Fisher’s LSD post hoc tests showed that baseline heart rate was slower than any of the game play outcomes (p < .001 for all values). Near-misses triggered significantly higher heart rates than regular losses (p = .05) but the average HR for wins did not statistically differ from near-misses (p = .30). Wins had higher heart rates than regular losses (p = .03).

The changes in skin conductance levels (SCLs) over the final 30 s leading up to a win, loss or near-miss (or the last 30 s of the baseline period) are also shown in Fig. 5. This figure shows a general reduction in SCLs over time during the baseline period, an increase in SCLs over time for wins, and little change for losses and near-misses. A repeated measures ANOVA with a Greenhouse-Geisser correction indicated a significant main effect of SCL change by condition type, F(2.11,107.79) = 3.11, p = .04, η 2 = .06. Fischer’s LSD post hoc comparisons showed significantly larger slope increases for wins compared to near-misses (p = .02), but not losses (p = .13). Losses and near-misses were not statistically different (p = .83). The baseline epoch had significantly lower slopes than wins (p = .01) but not near-misses (p = .34) or losses (p = .21).

Post-reinforcement Pauses
Near-misses (M = 1.85, SD = .89), and losses (M = 1.92, SD = 1.03) had short PRPs compared to wins (M = 12.05, SD = 8.85). Repeated measures analyses with a Greenhouse Geisser correction indicated that there was a significant main effect of outcome type, F(1.01, 50.76) = 71.29, p < .001, η 2 = .58. Post-hoc comparisons indicated that PRP lengths for near-misses did not statistically differ from PRPs for losses (p = .60). However, PRPs for wins were statistically longer than PRPs for losses (p < .001) and near-misses (p < .001).

Subjective Measures
Average arousal ratings are shown in Fig. 6. The planned comparison between arousal ratings for near-misses and losses revealed that near-misses were more arousing outcomes than regular losses, t(56) = 2.16, SE = .077, p = .03. By contrast, the planned comparison of arousal ratings between wins and losses was not significant, t(56) = −1.37, SE = .124, p = .17, nor was the planned comparison between arousal ratings for wins and near-misses, t(56) = .05, SE = .05, p = .95.

For frustration (shown in Fig. 7), near-misses had the highest frustration ratings, followed by losses, and wins. The planned comparison between frustration ratings for near-misses and losses indicated that near-misses were significantly more frustrating than losses, t(56) = 2.01, SE = .12, p = .04. Expectedly, frustration following wins was statistically lower than losses, t(56) = 10.50, SE = .19, p < .001, and statistically lower than near-misses, t(56) = −10.41, SE = .21, p < .001.

Discussion
In the present study, participants experienced three types of outcomes in Candy Crush during 30 min of playing a real version of the game: Wins (when they levelled up), full losses (when they failed to level up) and near-misses (when they came close to levelling up). Based on previous research, we expected wins to be highly arousing, highly rewarding, and highly motivating.

At the most general level, our heart rate findings show that compared to the baseline epoch, playing Candy Crush is an exciting, arousing experience. Heart rate for game play was elevated compared to baseline heart rate. Importantly, such increases in arousal were likely due to game excitement as opposed to differences in the movements required in the game compared to the baseline condition. As a baseline, we specifically chose a non-exciting (rotor pursuit) task which nonetheless required finger movements comparable to those required in the game. This greater HR reactivity during gameplay has been consistently observed in previous research even when (as in this study) researchers controlled for metabolic demands due to movement (Turner et al. 1983; Carroll et al. 1984).

Our analysis of changes in skin conductance levels provided some, albeit weaker, converging evidence for this relationship. Baseline periods were associated with the largest decreases in SCLs, converging with the lowest heart rates. We note however, that for SCL changes, the baseline was only different from wins, not from losses or near-misses. It is quite possible that SCL changes may have been contaminated by the periodic swiping movements in the game. If so, the changes in SCL slopes over time may depend on how many moves were made in the last 30 s and the delays between swipes. As such we placed greater import on the heart rate measures which were not influenced by play movements.

As predicted, near-miss outcomes in Candy Crush produced significantly greater elevations in heart rate compared to regular losses. The subjective arousal ratings converge to show that just failing to level up in these games is significantly more arousing than not coming close to winning. It is reasonable to assume that as the number of available moves declines, players become more aroused in anticipation that they can attain a win. Specifically, the player begins to strive to make the correct moves with the expectation that a win is close at hand. Such mentations serve to increase heart rate and subjective arousal. When, however, they run out of moves just prior to levelling up players become frustrated (as evidenced by their high frustration ratings)—significantly more frustrated than for regular losses. Such frustration is nonetheless highly motivating, as players report greater urge to play following near-misses than following regular losses. Although near-misses are objectively equivalent to regular losses in that neither outcome results in goal attainment, gambling research suggests that near-misses trigger the urge to continue play and can lead to excessive play (Clark et al. 2009; Côté et al. 2003; Billieux et al. 2012).

As predicted, wins were highly arousing both subjectively and physiologically as evidenced by notable augmentations in heart rate and subjective ratings of arousal. They also appeared to be rewarding—wins triggered longer post-reinforcement pauses than any other outcome. Yet, despite their rewarding properties, urge following wins did not differ statistically from urge ratings following losses or near-misses. Since Candy Crush wins are periodic and unpredictable (likely occurring in a random ratio schedule similar to slot machines), it was expected that wins would be a powerful reinforcement of behaviour in this context (Ferster and Skinner 1957; Haw 2008). The absence of significantly greater urge ratings for wins compared to losses and near-misses warrants further investigation in order to reliably understand the reinforcing nature of wins in Candy Crush. If players are less inclined to continue play following wins, it can be speculated that winning may actually be a natural stopping point for these players as the incentive to continue may temporarily dwindle with goal achievement (e.g. completing a level) (Berridge 2004).

The findings concerning how near-misses trigger increases in the urge to continue play are particularly intriguing. They suggest that anticipatory arousal can be a primary motivator of future behaviour without the necessity of monetary reward. This finding supports the contention that near-misses can impact motivation regardless of the nature of the reward (Anderson and Brown 1984; Brown 1986). The anticipatory arousal prior to the near-miss in Candy Crush and the frustration that follows appears to be potent enough to invigorate further play even in a game where there is no possibility of monetary gain. Thus, Candy Crush appears to be intrinsically motivating to players, and near-misses invigorate this motivation to the similar extent of wins as demonstrated in the gambling literature (Clark et al. 2012; Côté et al. 2003; Kassinove and Schare 2001; Billieux et al. 2012).

In sum, we show that near-misses have profound effects on arousal, frustration and urge even in games where there is no possibility of monetary reward. These findings may have implications for more complex videogames as discussed by Karlsen (2011). For example, in the realm of Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPG), the arousal, frustration and urge-to-continue triggered by near-misses (just failing to achieve an objective) may impact decision-making in terms of when to quit a given game session.

One limitation of this study was our inability to show near-miss induced increases in arousal using both heart rate and skin conductance levels. Although the predicted effects were shown in heart rate, we failed to find converging evidence from our skin conductance measures. Because we used a real version of Candy Crush we could not manipulate (and counterbalance) the order in which outcomes occurred. Additionally, the fact that we had participants play levels slightly below their skill level and on a tablet rather than on a participants preferred device, may have disrupted the naturalism of game play. Thus, future research could consider having players play games directly from their device at their current level of success to maximize the potential of affective responses to outcome events. Moreover, since the effect of Candy Crush near-misses on urge has been observed, future research can investigate the behavioural consequence of such urge in terms of persistence in play.

Another limitation of this study concerns the post-reinforcement pause lengths following winning outcomes. In Candy Crush, following a winning outcome the players experience a series of eye-catching animations and exciting sounds. Unlike in slots games where players can, with the press of a button, immediately advance to the next game, Candy Crush players must wait until the cessation of these animations before playing a new game in naturalistic play. Thus, had we used the temporal duration between the outcome being revealed and the actual initiation of the next game as a measure of PRPs, these PRPs would be artificially inflated following wins by the presence of the uninterruptable animations. To circumvent this problem, we had players press an external button when they were ready to answer the subjective questions pertaining to that button. Thus, theoretically they could press button this at any time following outcome delivery (either immediately, or following a delay of variable length). Although a substantial portion of our sample initiated a button press during the playing of the animations, some players waited until the end of the animations. Thus it is difficult to get a precise estimate of the length of the true post-reinforcement pause for all participants. To get such a precise estimate, one would have to remove the animations that are played following wins—an empirical move that would dramatically reduce ecological validity.

In our version of Candy Crush, we did not subject players to “lock out” periods. In normal game play, players are only given a few chances to level up before being “locked-out” of the game for a set period of time (i.e., 30 min). Yet, to circumvent this waiting period, players are given the opportunity to make a purchase (termed micro-transaction) to resume play immediately. Although we did not use “lock out” periods our findings nonetheless may have implications toward this micro-purchasing behaviour. Specifically, as players get “locked out” following a certain number of failures, the combination of frustration and urge to continue play following a near-miss may lead players to actually pay to continue their play. Recent research has suggested that micro-transactions made in casual games, especially in those that feature gambling relevant themes, are a risk factor to migration to online gambling—even in players who have not engaged in the activity before (Kim et al. 2015). This link is especially concerning considering that players who engage in regular social games like Candy Crush may potentially play gambling relevant social games as well (King et al. 2015). Such purchasing behaviour made in these games may as such have broader, more nefarious implications. Naturally, more investigation is necessary to actually demonstrate that near-misses preferentially influence one’s decision to make micro-transactions in these types of games.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that Candy Crush near-misses appear to have similar psychological and physiological impacts on Candy Crush players as slot-machine near-misses have on gamblers. Specifically, Candy Crush near-misses, just like their gambling-game counterparts, are physiologically arousing, and frustrating, yet motivate the urge to play.

Average urge ratings are shown in Fig. 8. The planned comparisons revealed that near-misses triggered significantly greater urge than losses, t(56) = 1.95, SE = .19, p = .05. The planned comparison between urge ratings for wins and losses was not statistically significant, t(56) = −.52, SE = .24, p = .60. Additionally, the planned comparison between urge ratings for wins and near-misses was also not statistically significant, t(56) = −1.11, SE = .22, p = .27.

Do that fake game code thing, where we give them a little extra life right at the end of their mana meter bar, or any bar, we keep that there artificially, to give the players a feeling of a near miss, we just stretch out that buffer zone, to get the players more in that zone, more times

As predicted, near-miss outcomes in Candy Crush produced significantly greater elevations in heart rate compared to regular losses. The subjective arousal ratings converge to show that just failing to level up in these games is significantly more arousing than not coming close to winning. It is reasonable to assume that as the number of available moves declines, players become more aroused in anticipation that they can attain a win. Specifically, the player begins to strive to make the correct moves with the expectation that a win is close at hand. Such mentations serve to increase heart rate and subjective arousal. When, however, they run out of moves just prior to levelling up players become frustrated (as evidenced by their high frustration ratings)—significantly more frustrated than for regular losses. Such frustration is nonetheless highly motivating, as players report greater urge to play following near-misses than following regular losses. Although near-misses are objectively equivalent to regular losses in that neither outcome results in goal attainment, gambling research suggests that near-misses trigger the urge to continue play and can lead to excessive play (Clark et al. 2009; Côté et al. 2003; Billieux et al. 2012).

As predicted, wins were highly arousing both subjectively and physiologically as evidenced by notable augmentations in heart rate and subjective ratings of arousal. They also appeared to be rewarding—wins triggered longer post-reinforcement pauses than any other outcome. Yet, despite their rewarding properties, urge following wins did not differ statistically from urge ratings following losses or near-misses. Since Candy Crush wins are periodic and unpredictable (likely occurring in a random ratio schedule similar to slot machines), it was expected that wins would be a powerful reinforcement of behaviour in this context (Ferster and Skinner 1957; Haw 2008). The absence of significantly greater urge ratings for wins compared to losses and near-misses warrants further investigation in order to reliably understand the reinforcing nature of wins in Candy Crush. If players are less inclined to continue play following wins, it can be speculated that winning may actually be a natural stopping point for these players as the incentive to continue may temporarily dwindle with goal achievement (e.g. completing a level) (Berridge 2004).

The findings concerning how near-misses trigger increases in the urge to continue play are particularly intriguing. They suggest that anticipatory arousal can be a primary motivator of future behaviour without the necessity of monetary reward. This finding supports the contention that near-misses can impact motivation regardless of the nature of the reward (Anderson and Brown 1984; Brown 1986). The anticipatory arousal prior to the near-miss in Candy Crush and the frustration that follows appears to be potent enough to invigorate further play even in a game where there is no possibility of monetary gain. Thus, Candy Crush appears to be intrinsically motivating to players, and near-misses invigorate this motivation to the similar extent of wins as demonstrated in the gambling literature (Clark et al. 2012; Côté et al. 2003; Kassinove and Schare 2001; Billieux et al. 2012).

In sum, we show that near-misses have profound effects on arousal, frustration and urge even in games where there is no possibility of monetary reward. These findings may have implications for more complex videogames as discussed by Karlsen (2011). For example, in the realm of Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPG), the arousal, frustration and urge-to-continue triggered by near-misses (just failing to achieve an objective) may impact decision-making in terms of when to quit a given game session.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that Candy Crush near-misses appear to have similar psychological and physiological impacts on Candy Crush players as slot-machine near-misses have on gamblers. Specifically, Candy Crush near-misses, just like their gambling-game counterparts, are physiologically arousing, and frustrating, yet motivate the urge to play.

A CandyCrush AppStore review

When you fail a level, normally you can see that you only need one simple move to pass it. It gives me the option for 5 more moves, but you have to buy it with “gold bars”. Like, who wants “gold bars”? You spend way too much money to BUY them, so no, I’m not using gold bars. I don’t even know how you earn them! I got 5 for downloading the app, and that’s all I’ve ever received. You would think they would have a solution if you went to the help center, but no. I get that they have to gather money somehow, but they would get far more if they didn’t charge $3 a pop. More people would buy, more money. But it also makes no sense to put in your credit card number and spend all your sweet time to buy a 10 pack of gold bars for $3.00. It will also give you and option to “spin the wheel”. No one EVER gets the jackpot, because it’s rigged. Like, why would you even put the jackpot on there if no one can get it?! Plus it gives you an option to spin and win a “booster”. Like why would you want a booster if your out of moves and can’t use it to pass your level?! They could at least give you one more move to burst that one jelly cube you have left. Other that the above, this game is totally awesome!



Same reason chess is addicting, we are always just that “one” blunder away from winning

How can we make the city building game like chess, in that we are one move away from winning?
