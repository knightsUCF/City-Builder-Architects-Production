Going over the document, "Let's Go Whaling", the author mentions that only 1% is sold by hats.

This goes against what Crossy Road did.

But perhaps that is different because they were selling you characters.

In any case keep offering the cosmetic, but since he mentions that progress is the main one, perhaps there is some way of
giving out progress for money, that is not entirely pay to play. So perhaps the player can purchase gold, which can then be used
to unlock further levels, while other players have to beat the AI on hard to unlock a level, or to receive those coins. They can 
also pay coins to get those levels.

What are other ways of giving out progress for gold?

Afterwards when the players are maxed out, can no longer sell progress, but consumables. Faster healing times, and faster
build times seem so cheap. Not sure how to get around this. Study clash of clans.


Offer gifts so players can gift each other (reciprocity) and increase sells of cosmetic stuff.
