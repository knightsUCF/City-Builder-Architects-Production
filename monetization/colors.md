Lots of people talk shit about mobile games, and how they are childish, and wonder how they attract so many customers.

From the "Making games that sell" GDC talk, the only inference the algorithm could discern was that more colors (perhaps more
bright colors) had a direct associate with sales.

So perhaps we don't have to simply copy the over cute art style, but still we would want to have nice colors, that will attract
customers.
