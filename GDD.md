Playtest for emotions, not just mechanics!

Seems like a huge element for Tom Vasel's favorite board game, Project Elite, is the time element of 2 minutes, so actions have to be taken fast. Same sort of thing why people love to play 1 minute chess games, because of the time element. A very long chess game is not nearly as enjoyable, and even tiring as a short chess, where all sorts of things can occur under the time element.

This is perhaps why this singular board game climbed up so high on Tom's list, because most board games are slow, but here you have two minutes to get everything done, almost like speed chess, so likewise increase the pace in the game so actions have to be taken quickly. Perhaps there is even a speed bonus for workers walking. This might be too much not sure. But a type of game where in multiplayer, even when playing on the same team versus AI, there is a frenzy pace inside of 1 / 2 minutes. This could even be done in phases. While LOTR has this kind of speed all throughout the game. So basically just keep the pace up.

Another huge thing could be worker cooperation between players, so they could be shouting to each other while playing, "Move that worker there! Or, come help me construct this thing to speed things up! Change of plan! Move your worker here! Produce more workers! Get the produce worker bonus! Upgrade your base!"

"EYO" "Io" - a unique name, maybe some short Japanese name, maybe something that means something, doesn't have to mean anything like Starbucks


Upgrading structures! Structures give special abilities. What if most structures we have three or four upgrades to select like in LOTR, and then only some structures actually have outward upgrades. Definitley for the first version like Sid Meier, said, make the game bigger than seems to the player, so on the upgradse have a few\, 3 or 4 upgrades per building, they also have to be done in order, to time the build mechanisms.

Players can choose different starting characters. Each have special abilities, or start with a different resource amount for major replayability. Since these will be just mathematical operations, and we can just call the player "Entrepreneur", or whatever, we don't necessarily need any extra graphics for the first version. Each of these will give some sort of bonus ugprade. Perhaps when we are selecting the different abilities we could have a vector icon, stylish, for each of the different "starting factions". This could be on a black background, and the icons could really pop. Also color code this part. Make sure the icons and the black are part of some sort of color scheme.


When beginning have to only build along a road, or within some sort of required radius, that way there is some order. 

Can't destroy the player's structures, but can place your workers there to get bonuses.

"This game is an economic masterpiece

Like seriously this game is fantastic and i recommend it to all my classmates in the econ department. It teaches you so many practical things about markets.

Supply and Demand - This game models this perfectly at basic level, more demand while quantity supplied remains the same, price increases. More producers enter the market while demand remains the same, price goes down. Perfect modeling of supply and demand at a conceptual level.

Monopolies are bad - In economics a monopoly or an oligopoly will always produce less then the socially optimal quantity and above the equilibrium price level. For example, lets say you have a water monopoly, you are incentivezed in this game to under-supply to the market in order to keep profits high.

Barganing- Auctions are a great example of the Coase Therom, or that efficient outcomes can be reached when parties have zero transaction costs

Economies of scale - Production is more efficient in some industries when you expand the size of operations, this is shown through adjacency bonuses.

Patents - Good example of how firms compete by trying to gain a technical edge over rivals.

You could give this game to a freshmen and it would teach them everything they would learn in an econ 101 class. Keep up the good work!!!. I would love to see a longer game-mode available, one where there are multiple cities and firms enter and exit the market over 100s of sols. And maybe a mechanic to prevent snowballing so that the game stays strategic to the very end."



Machi Koro city building card game! https://www.idwgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Machi-RULES-reduced.pdf

An interesting mechanic, is when you offer a player an option, which benefits or does something to all players on that action. So if they choose that, then all players benefit, but that might not be a good thing, depending on the strategy of the current or future situation.

Another version of this is, if players build shopping malls together in one location, then they will all collectively benefit from the increased traffic. There could be further strategies here, like buying out the competition so you can gain a monolopy on the traffic, but things are not so simple, like Offworld Trading Company, where if you monopolize one thing, and price goes up too high, your stock can crash if there are no buyers. That would be very interesting. For each business that you buy, for each franchise, or some, you are awarded company stock. And if bad things happen to your company the stock crashes and your company becomes worthless. Investigate how Offshore Trading Company does this.

An even further micromanagement strategy of this is, that you could select custom goods for sale at each shop. So you can pay attention to the supply and demand, and focus on buying up (from a global supplier, everyone has access to, the market, like in Offshore Trading Company). We could start off with simple 3 or 4 items for sale. Some nice icons when you click on the store. Nothing too overwhelming. At the same time the player has the option to just generically populate the stores with goods, so the game allows for micromanagement, but doesn't force micromanagement.

The price offered at the stores should be set 1:1 everywhere. So we can't decide to sell for more directly by changing the price. But we can try to raise prices by buying up goods in the market, thus increasing the demand by lowering the supply. Again study how Offshore Trading Company does this, namely how do they set a global supply, how much of this global supply is there, and what determines when something goes up or down in price, what is this mechanism. 


AS there is more traffic established around an area, the shops, and other commercial structures begin to earn more money, since there is more business. This is easy to do, since we are just going to be increasing traffic, and detecting the increase and rewarding with money. 

Have two worker types, one type is generic worker types same color, and the other are hero type workers

Perhaps the player can customize their figures with hair and sunglasses, for example? What about clothes? No clothes for now

Can sell cosmetic stuff in the store, like for example sun glasses, not sure about the hair yet though

When purchase the glasses that is only for one pair


Something happens every ten seconds, and you can see the event coming. What makes Civilization by Sid Meier addictiing.

Names: megalopolitan, Cityopolis

Cutting down wood for resources, can also be good in that we have the player waiting longer for things to happen

Can do a campaign on Fiver. Nothing to lose.


If the name is short, the icon logo could be the outline of the words, and inside the buildings, and outside just white, with a nice outline or shine for the app.


Collect physical bouncing blocks as resources, yellow - energy, blue - ?, green - money


Have a nice grid glowing outline of the powergrid and water systems in one of the preview screenshots on the app store. 

Make the most innovative city builder, and the one that feels most like a game. 

Study box cover art of classic games from the 90s.

The games that left an impression on me as a child all had a strong soul:

- XCOM: Enemy Unknown 1994
- Polanie
- Three Vikings
- Doom
- Mortal Kombat


XCOM did the same thing with the "filled" design logo!

Nice colors for the grid of XCOM

Use a nice color scheme similar to this

In XCOM the game decided whether to give you more or less funding based on progress



As we have more traffic roads, including on both sides of the building, and more tiles in general, and more turns around the building, we get more points from the traffic there, for example more customers around the shops, we get points for that

This introduces a lot of strategy, since we can maximize resources, in a small space by strategically arranging the available roads (for money), around the shops, and etc, for example focus on shops, or on one thing in the early game, goes along with the concept of many strategies to play


# Purchasing Land

Purchasing land could be a strategic element. We could present the player with the ability to purchase how much land they want up to their resources max. Or up to map max we can support on their device. (Determine through testing). Well, the strategic element comes into play depending on how fast they spend on land in the beginning, they have to manage to not be greedy and buy too much land, although they can restart the game at any time if they mess up or put themselves in a corner.
