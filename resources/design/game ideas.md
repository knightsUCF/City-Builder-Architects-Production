if so can have ships going around port, delivering stuff, and doing other stuff, this could be a future update

6. Game system should have a life of its own, that repeatedly generates experiences that are fresh and engaging, about systems and dynamics, the actors in this system should appear to be intelligent and responsive to thep layrs actions. Doesn't have to be that intelligent, just appear to be intelligent. And the player will get the feeling they are dealing with intelligent creatures, and have to make intelligent decisions. Single player emergent gameplay.
