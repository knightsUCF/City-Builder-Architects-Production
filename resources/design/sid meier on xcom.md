"I think that each player is playing their own unique game. They are the stars, as we consider it. They're driving that story and creating their own unique story. That's fundamental to the enjoyment of these kinds of games. You're not going down the one single path that the designers created for you. You can take things in whatever way you want to. It's your game. It's not a game that belongs to us." — Sid Meier

"[Solomon] always spoke from the player's point of view, which to me is key," Meier tells Polygon, in a recent interview at Firaxis. "It's very easy to speak from a programmer's point of view and say, 'We could add this cool technology' or 'We could do this whiz-bang thing.' That's cool, but it really doesn't add a lot to the player's experience."


"We get that kind of feedback when we go to trade shows, conventions, GDCs [Game Developer Conferences], wherever; running into people who say, 'I played this game when I was a kid. When is there going to be another?' That kind of enthusiasm ... is really an integral part of what we do. We're very fortunate to be able to make fun, and to have that fun bounce back to us and energize us and inspire us again is great." — Sid Meier

"I was enthused by his enthusiasm," Meier says. "I love the [XCOM] game concept. I think it's a wonderful idea. It's a very exciting idea. It's a classic problem that we have of taking an idea that was great 10, 15, 20 years ago and bringing it into the present. What do you keep? What do you change? What does today's audience expect? What is the fan base for that [XCOM] expecting? How do you meet all those expectations?"

"A lot of us became game designers because there were games that we wanted to play that hadn't been made yet or hadn't been made the way we thought they should have been made," Meier says. "When I started designing games, the field was wide open. I was able to make a game about pirates, and railroads, and civilization, all sorts of cool topics that I thought were fun. Games hadn't really been made about them."


Making games can be easier now. The tools are better. The teams are larger. It's easier to pick up a game engine and crack together a prototype. But, as Solomon discovered in 2003, making a good game is still hard work. After working with his small team for six months, Solomon unveiled his XCOM prototype ... and it was terrible.

"It was mouse-driven and it was tile-based, but it was this weird sort of ... UI was not my strong suit," Solomon says.
The final product didn't have buttons, UFOs, buildings or fun. The maps were gigantic. Solomon calls it a "hotkey-driven fuckin' mess." Players were asked to memorize a mammoth amount of data just to control the game, then wander in a massive open area with only two aliens to shoot. It was "un-fun."


"I love designing games. I enjoy the process of watching them come to life. They start with just a wild and crazy idea and a lot of optimism. Then, day by day, you have to build a little piece of that final product. There are good days and bad days." — Sid Meier

"A team was available," Meier says. "We needed a game. [We said] 'What's the best idea we have floating around here that's not Civilization?'"

"I grew up playing Sid's games," Solomon says. "But when you work for somebody day in and day out, you view them as ... I could tell he was brilliant. I could tell he was a genius. But the way he makes it look easy, you're kind of like ... This is where I got into trouble."

"The design was pretty far off, in terms of the actual mechanics," Solomon says. "Design-wise, in my mind ... Enemy Unknown was going to be almost an exact remake of the original game."

Solomon carried that flag for a long time. He wanted the game's levels to be procedurally generated, so that players could play the game forever, essentially, and never once see the same map. The programmers told him it couldn't be done. There was tension.

"It came down to a question of ... If we do this, if we do procedurally generated maps, they said that they were going to look like shit," Solomon says. "It wasn't going to look like any of the other games. I mean, we're not trying look better than every other game out there, but it wouldn't have even looked comparable. We would have looked like fuckin' shit."

By 2009, the tone video had given way to a "vertical slice," essentially a short demo displaying the core concepts as Solomon envisioned them. And there were a lot of them.


"Up until that point I sort of felt like ... It just all seemed to be going so well," Solomon says. "The game looked great. Nobody had been able to play it because it had taken a really long time to get the game code running, but it looked great. We were thrilled that we were making a new XCOM. It was so exciting. ... But in the weeks after the vertical slice, when the feedback started coming in, that was the first moment when I ... I grew up as a designer.
"That was my first realization that this whole first year had basically netted us something that wasn't very fun. We were stepping on this path where I started to realize ... this game is not going to work."


"Every good game design has three or four core ideas that are going to make it fun for the player. You have to believe in those core ideas. Once everything comes together, it's going to be fun. It's going to be awesome. You have to keep that vision and that idea in mind." — Sid Meier


Meier's office is spacious, but not as spacious as you might expect. It is also cluttered. It is the room of a man who does a lot of thinking. The walls are covered with shelves, which strain under the burden of a residue of the entire history of video game design: books, photographs, game boxes, manuals, knickknacks. Meier's desk rests roughly halfway into the room, off to one side. Beside his desk is an anomalous green chair.



The green chair is a large, overstuffed La-Z-Boy recliner. It is has been worn by years of good use. It looks dramatically comfortable and the shocking kelly green color suggests that this is a piece of furniture that would find no other home than in the office of a man who answers to practically no one.

"He claims there's something about sitting in that chair that allows him to collect his thoughts," Meier says. "Things become clearer. Whenever I come to my office and I see him sitting there, I know it's time to have a little chat and we're going to move on and solve this problem."

"We believe in the same kinds of games," Meier says. "We believe the same things are fun. So in terms of games I think we're pretty compatible. But in our personalities, our extroversion versus introversion, and in many other ways, we're different.

"Part of our design process is not to insert our personalities into the game. It's more to insert our sensibilities, our ideas about what makes good games. In that regard we're pretty compatible."



Sid Meier works alone. In his not-too-spacious office with the overfull bookshelves and the overstuffed green chair, Meier writes much of the code for the various games that have his name on the box. Then the teams of artists and programmers at Firaxis work to make that code into games. Working with the art and program teams to make sense of what Meier has written is where someone like Jake Solomon comes in — working with Meier to make sense of what they send back to him.


"This is kind of what Bruce Shelley did for Sid as well. Sid makes the game, you play it and you say, 'Hey, I didn't like this, or this part was really boring.' It got to the point where Sid and I were really close. I'd say, 'Aw, this is fuckin' terrible!' And Sid, all mild-mannered, would say, 'OK ...' Based on feedback he'd change this or change that. That was the point where I thought, 'Hey, I can do this. I'm telling Sid Meier how shit should go. I must be the world's best fuckin' designer if I can sit here and tell Sid Meier what's the problem with his game.'"

"'Our job is to make a fun XCOM and we've completely failed at it,'" Solomon recalls saying at the time. "It was a really hard moment, because up until that point, I had probably not had any real stress. When the feedback started coming back, I was thinking, 'Holy shit. Here I am. I'm the designer. I have this vision, and almost unequivocally, everyone thinks it's not fun.' That's when, as a designer, you start to think, 'OK ... I have no answers.'"
As you might expect, Sid Meier has been in this place before as a game designer. He even has a name for it. He calls it "The Valley of Despair."


"You start a project with very high hopes and expectations and visions of what the game is going to be and how awesome it's going to be. Some of those are realized and some of those are not. In the middle of the game, not everything works, not everything looks as good as it should and you're a little burnt out. You've seen it a hundred times. You're maybe wondering whether you're the only one that's having fun, the only one that likes this game, the only one that believes in it. You have to push through that with a little bit of faith. ... That's the Valley of Despair." — Sid Meier

One of the lessons Jake Solomon learned over the years from Sid Meier is that, as a designer, you can't ignore the feedback. Feedback is fact. If someone has a feeling about your game, that feeling is irrefutable. It is something you must take into account. And if enough people have the same feeling, then there's a problem and it must be addressed.

"It's hard to even describe now," Solomon says. "I don't know what I was thinking. It was the original game, and then over the top of that I had put ... soldier abilities ... a cover system ... new alien abilities ... new weapons. It was ... incredibly complicated — not complex. Complex is fun, complicated is bad. This was a very complicated game. It was more complicated than the original."

"I went to [Foertsch and Lead Programmer Casey O'Toole] and I said, 'Look, we have to start over. I have a new idea. But everything we just worked on for 10 or 11 months or whatever, we're gonna have to scrap it.'"


"Obviously, when we started to make [the vertical slice] we thought we knew what we were doing," says O'Toole. "We thought we had all the answers. It seemed like the obvious route to go. Then you get there and you have this realization where you're like, 'Man, this is like pulling teeth. It's just not fun.' It's just part of the process.
"A lot of companies make a design document or they have a design and that's it. But everything we do is more alive and more fluid. It changes constantly. That's part of the development process for this company. It's expected that you're going to run in and make a little bit of a U-turn. What you thought was going to be good and fun is going to change into something that you actually discover to be good and fun."


What would end up not making the cut were a lot of design elements pulled directly from the original game and some that Solomon had pulled out of ... the ether (he would say "my ass"). The team went back to the drawing board, focused on what did work and what was fun and forged a new plan that would take them through another three years of iteration, evaluation and potential failure. It would be another two years before the game would be playable again.

"I guess it comes down to the feeling that we're, in some sense, being creative. That we're doing something. It's not a science. We don't have all the rules figured out. But if we're smart and creative today, this game will be better than it was at the beginning of the day. That's part of what motivates us." — Sid Meier


Jake Solomon was slowly emerging from the Valley of Despair. Work was progressing on a new direction for XCOM. Bad design was being thrown out the window. Good design was replacing it. The system was working. And, almost unbelievably, the game was still on schedule.

"I couldn't make it work with all the things that I'd added to it," Solomon says. "And so I started to iterate on the strategy game. I started to change it. I started to add all these different elements to it. I made it a turn-based game. Then I made it another real-time game, but it's like a real-time tower defense version of the strategy layer. Then I made a turn-based card-based strategy game, which should horrify people.
"That was when I was waking up in the morning and like ... I was not even wanting to go into work, because I knew I was so far off the path at that point. I'd iterated so much that it didn't even look like XCOM."
Meier encouraged Solomon to completely scrap what he had already made and start over.


Meier and Solomon hammered out some ideas and then created a prototype XCOM strategy game using cards, model tanks and pieces from the board game Risk.
"We drew on paper or on the whiteboard," Solomon says. "We'd draw the earth and we'd say, 'OK. Alien invasion strategy game. This is how it works.' From a very high level, which is where you have to start. You have to say, 'What are the big choices? What's the player doing every turn?' That can be real-time, but there are these discrete moments where the players are making choices. What are those choices? What is the player weighing? What are they doing?"


Over the course of two weeks, Solomon would continue to design the tactical game on the right side of the former spice building, and in the afternoons he would sit in Meier's green chair on the left side. The two would spend hours playing their homemade XCOM strategy board game, tweaking and refining and solving the problem, one roll of the dice at a time.

Eventually Meier and Solomon refined their makeshift strategy game to the point where they needed to make a major decision regarding how to move forward. Meier suggested a turn-based solution; Solomon advocated real-time. They were at an impasse.
"[Meier] said, 'Look, OK. We are both programmers,'" Solomon recalls. "It was a Friday. He says, 'Let's go home over the weekend. I'm going to write a prototype. You write a prototype. We'll get back together. We'll play each other's prototypes and we'll see what we think.'"


"We never know. We know that we like the game. We know that we're having fun. We know that it's the best work that we can do. But every game is an adventure from the beginning to the end. We were very pleasantly surprised with the response [to XCOM: Enemy Unknown], with the enthusiasm, with what we're hearing from players. It was surprising. A smidgen of relief, probably, because again, you never know what the response is going to be." — Sid Meier
