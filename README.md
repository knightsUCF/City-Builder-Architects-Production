# City-Builder-Architects-Production


# Set up production ready project to do

- touch screen mobile controls, guided camera

- green landscape with trees as starting point

- splash screen

- menu screen

- music playing for game start

- building roads
  - roads can detect if they're placed down correctly with the slightly larger physics colliders, can have a front facing physics collider, and a back facing physics collider
  - if a back and a front, or a back, and a back (since tiles can be rotated touches), we can place a road there
  - player can also make an intersection, or a curved road, which is a separate tile for now, ease of use
  
- once roads are built we want to populate traffic

- once roads are built we can build other structures that have to be touching or within area of the roads

- those are the major things

- now to fine tune gameplay:
