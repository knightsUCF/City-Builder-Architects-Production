        // so now we want to trace this map data to determine the vectors of traffic


        // like Carmack said, there is no secret efficient algo, so just write this from scratch


        // first let's determine a simple line, the simplest traffic lane we can build


        // let's determine, the start, the middle, and the end, and then populate traffic

        // we will have to do intersections next, but just one thing at a time for now

        // also how will the systme react if we add new roads while the cars are already moving
