A combination between Machi Koro, "Game Concept Starter Pack" on the Asset store, Quadropolis, and Kingdoms and Castles.

This is the kind of style that cna work with the workers and the low poly world.

Very nice example of how this type of city could work with workers, also nice example of how to cleanly lay out the beach.

Each player can have some beach real estate, which is valuable, and can be taken over by other players later, or the beach real estate could be sold if the player is in trouble and needs funds. So they can put that on the market for any price they desire, and then get offers. Of course if they just wait with their high desired price, then they will lose time if they need the money.

Also the beach real estate could be an unlockable map.

Stores, and homes built along the beach have some sort of special bonus.


This looks like a very nice take on the beach shoreline, if somehow though we smooth out the rough polygons

The short pointy tree is nice, something that could vary up the contrast between the only tree we have right now. 

Study the Factory Town style: https://store.steampowered.com/app/860890/Factory_Town/

Try to at least outdo the art in that game, since that game in half a year has made 800K. 

We also should have rivers that connect land as islands. Then the player will want to build a bridge to get over the water for traffic, which is not a problem for the benefit added.




Carla the driving simulator, has some nice apartment buildings

Essentially these and other buildings are easy to create, because all we have to do is build one level, and then duplicate that level up.


Check out the way the lakes are laid out in factory town: https://store.steampowered.com/app/860890/Factory_Town/

Also check out the grass, might help to have grass when zoom

Perhaps we could have grass zoom in like in that one village building game
