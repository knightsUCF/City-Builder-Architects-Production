A combination between Machi Koro, "Game Concept Starter Pack" on the Asset store, Quadropolis, and Kingdoms and Castles.

This is the kind of style that cna work with the workers and the low poly world.

Very nice example of how this type of city could work with workers, also nice example of how to cleanly lay out the beach.

Each player can have some beach real estate, which is valuable, and can be taken over by other players later, or the beach real estate could be sold if the player is in trouble and needs funds. So they can put that on the market for any price they desire, and then get offers. Of course if they just wait with their high desired price, then they will lose time if they need the money.

Also the beach real estate could be an unlockable map.

Stores, and homes built along the beach have some sort of special bonus.


This looks like a very nice take on the beach shoreline, if somehow though we smooth out the rough polygons

The short pointy tree is nice, something that could vary up the contrast between the only tree we have right now.
