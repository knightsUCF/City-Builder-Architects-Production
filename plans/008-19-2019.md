# Create a simple traffic system

* Create a simple traffic system where we just lay down the gray tiles to create a road

* Don't worry about the cars yet

* Use the gray tiles as a way of having build conditions for building proximity

* For now create a few predetermined sets for AI traffic

* So instead of AI completly designing traffic on their own, they will choose from a "bag" of premade traffic, 
so like a T structure, a straight lane structure, and then just randomize these together

* Allow the AI then to just build along these
