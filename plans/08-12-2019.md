# Resource Gathering

* create building ability when clicking on a worker

* set grid size to 1 by 1 

* create ability for workers to chop wood

* have the workers bring the wood back to a wood resource structure, which can be just a block for now

* when workers arrive at work structure the wood token updates

* do the same for stone gathering


# Panel for Building Requirements

* create a simple panel or show on menu, or show if clicking or overlay, how much stone and wood is required to build each structure

* once the player gathers x wood and y stone they can build another structure

* until then they have a starting money amount, that they can use to build other structures immediately, or vary their strategy,
and save up their money, and gather resources instead in the meantime, which will open up the possibility space


# AI

* do everything for AI through events and FSM

* place the AI base a little ways away from the player

* have them also chop wood and gather resources

* set a simple strategy for the AI first, where they will first gather resources for buildings instead of spending their gold

* a cool thing later would be to set up randomized AI strategies, so one game the AI might focus immediately on resource gathering, and another game on using their gold to purchase stuff. If the player is in the area they can spy on the AI like in LOTR. But they are somehow driven away from the area, or caught somehow by the AI, not sure yet to go about this, then they lose their sight of vision. The cool thing would be to not always have a sight of vision accessible over the AI. So need to figure out some kind of mode where we would lose the sight of vision.

* so have the AI gathering resources, and then build a few different buildings, which can be just cubes for now

* make an onscreen log to keep track of the AIs progress so can guage competing against them over time

* the main optimization technique will be the wait times of the AI before they proceed to make another structure, and also later the order in which they accomplish things, which will be their strategy. So order = strategy

* later strategies can be coded as an "order of events"

* so at this point we would like to be able to mine wood and stone for both the player and AI, build a few different cubes, and have a simple win condition
