# Resource Gathering

* create building ability when clicking on a worker

* set grid size to 1 by 1 

* create ability for workers to chop wood

* have the workers bring the wood back to a wood resource structure, which can be just a block for now

* when workers arrive at work structure the wood token updates

* do the same for stone gathering


# Panel for Building Requirements

* create a simple panel or show on menu, or show if clicking or overlay, how much stone and wood is required to build each structure

* once the player gathers x wood and y stone they can build another structure

* until then they have a starting money amount, that they can use to build other structures immediately, or vary their strategy,
and save up their money, and gather resources instead in the meantime, which will open up the possibility space


# AI

* place the AI base a little ways away from the player

* have them also chop wood and gather resources
