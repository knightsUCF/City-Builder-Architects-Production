# ToDo Features

* task of the AI building on snap to grid

* create large box colliders for trees and the mountains, also change color of building block to signify we can't build there

* don't allow building over other buildings, and within the area perimeter

* any worker can build, unless they are inside a building working, then we first have to make them leave the building, before we can click on them to reveal the panel

* create some random people for both AI and player, color code them white or gray, these guys are just walking around, perhaps sometimes they go into a house, just to give illusion other people live there, but they are not workers, workers can only be generated from the employment office

* create difficulty level in the game settings screen, when we create a new game, let's go through this screen first, perhaps we could have a slider from 1 to 10 for difficulty, when the slider gets to 3 the caption changes to "Medium" when the slider moves past value 6, the caption changes to "Hard", so the player can have up to 10 modes. 

* create building rotation
