# Sellings Goods at Stores

* When we build a store, which will be just a cube at this point, create the ability to sell different goods at stores

* Get a few low poly items and place them in a neat square grid in a panel, which we can reveal when we click on the store.

* the player can then select which items they would like to sell at their store

* also have some simple info graphic on how much the item is sold for

* then create a central market panel, which shows all the available goods on the market

* so if the AI is selling something, show that in the market panel

* implement a simple supply and demand thing, so if the AI and the player are both selling the item, or only one is producing,
(at this point producing an item means simply selling an item, later there can be a distinction between producing items)

* if there is more supply of an item the price on the market goes down, if there is more demand the price of an item goes up

* there is auto demand if that item is only produced in small quantities by the player (maybe auto demand will change later, but for now just have auto demand)

* do the same for the AI





# Create Power and Water Grid Systems


* create a simple water and power system

* this will be done by simply snapping power lines to a grid

* when the player enters this mode, perhaps we dim the cameras on the world, or put a semi dark panel over the world (easier way),
and then we reveal either the power grid or the water grid

* the player can then snap the lines of the water transluscent blue pipes or power lines, (will need to make connectors for curved corners later,
don't do this now)

* also show some sort of area influence. Perhaps this can be a transculscent simple quad.

* when the player enters the grid system mode, zoom out the camera for them to a location above the map, just an option, not sure about this yet
