# Map Design

* study the jagged borders of Northgard

* include more water borders, and bridges for traffic, like in Kingdoms and Castles

* create a jagged border like from the camping

* shape the jagged formation in a neat square like pattern but not as obvious as Kingdoms and Castles

* create some temporary low poly design for the plains, to have shades of green and yellow, even if only have three shades (color theme them), they will make a big difference
