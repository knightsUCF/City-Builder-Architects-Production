# Replayability - Starting Classes

An amazing way to do starting classes is to simply give the option of what you're starting with as a text element, 
so Entrepreneur, etc (find where the classes were)

And then next to the class we show a simple count next to each of the starting elements.

So if choosing Entrepreneur: 3 x (workers icon), 100 x gold icon, etc, essentially showing the starting resources for that class type.

This way we can easily set up the fun of replayability and vary the strategy.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

* create a new game start panel, which shows up after the player presses start

* the game panel should be part of the Game scene, so there is no loading time between the start game settings panel and the actual game,
so the first scene, Menu will take us to "Loading...", and after that we will change scene and start with a game start settings overlay,
so when the player presses start game, there will be no loading time
