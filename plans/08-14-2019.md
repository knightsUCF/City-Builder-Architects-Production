# Replayability - Starting Classes

An amazing way to do starting classes is to simply give the option of what you're starting with as a text element, 
so Entrepreneur, etc (find where the classes were)

And then next to the class we show a simple count next to each of the starting elements.

So if choosing Entrepreneur: 3 x (workers icon), 100 x gold icon, etc, essentially showing the starting resources for that class type.

This way we can easily set up the fun of replayability and vary the strategy.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

* create a new game start panel, which shows up after the player presses start

* the game panel should be part of the Game scene, so there is no loading time between the start game settings panel and the actual game,
so the first scene, Menu will take us to "Loading...", and after that we will change scene and start with a game start settings overlay,
so when the player presses start game, there will be no loading time


# Worker Stats

Create panel on which we can view all the worker stats. 

Also allow placing workers at structures, so they can level up and generate the resource at that structure and use any bonuses that are available.

For example, placing a store worker at a store levels up their commerce. With higher commerce perhaps we get a discount on acquiring the items we sell.

# Standard Assets Third Person Control

* review the Santa demo how to apply the third person controller to the characters, which can take care a lot of the things

* don't mess with the animations before this, like for building, because this will likely have the state controller built in
