* create a simple on screen log of what the AI is doing, a nice log would have some kind of scroll, or perhaps we can just move up the last two messages to the upper two

* create few houses, will run into the order of the event building problem, and also will need to set aside later task of the AI building on snap to grid

* create a simple win condition

* create ability to build stores

* once we click on stores show a panel of what we can sell (find some nice graphics for this)

* for now make the simplest possible solution, so out of all the items we can select 2 items to sell 

* create a global market condition with the AI also selling items

* create ability to buy and sell goods, there will be the goods that we manufacture that we can sell, and then there will be global market goods we can buy, review Offworld Trading Company for this

* create a new win condition based on the demand and supply of the market, maybe based on whoever reaches an x amount of money
