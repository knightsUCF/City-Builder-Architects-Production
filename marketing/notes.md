(new article part 2 coming out soon)

build up email list, very important

"Head on over to Mailchimp, and set up an account there. Mailchimp is going to be your friend – it collects emails, creates landing pages, and does a bunch of legally-compliancey stuff that you won’t want to worry about.
If you head over to their Landing Page creator, you can set up something quick and dirty to start capturing e-mail leads. Here’s the one I made, for example. I’m not going to pretend to be an expert on the matter, but you want to give people a preview of what you are doing, some cool graphics to draw them in, and then a call to action and motivation to join your community."

"What can you offer? Think about what you would want from someone else. Would you give an email out for nothing? How about a print and play? Honestly? Probably not. Most people don’t bother printing out PNP files, and even if they do, getting them to play it is a whole ‘nother battle.
An easy thing to offer is a copy of your game, or a unique perk, or some exclusivity. You want to create the atmosphere of a members-only club, and that idea that they are helping become a part of something bigger. Because that’s what we are doing – building something more than the sum of its’ parts."

perhaps we could offer a free desktop version of the game in exchange for the email, at least offer something

"If you want, you can even buy a domain through Mailchimp, but it’s a bit pricey. I’d recommend going to another domain provider and redirecting your traffic to a landing page. This costs only a few bucks a year."


"Regardless of your tone, a good ad will almost always be: concise, clean, and convincing. You want to get your idea across quickly and in a few sentences. Text needs to be easy to digest, and focus on what makes your offering unique. Clean means no spelling or grammar mistakes because those stick out like a sore thumb. And for your ad to be convincing, you need to have a call to action and a reason for them to click through."
