I asked 33 top marketers (like Noah Kagan, Dan Norris, Brian Dean, and Peep Laja) for their #1 email marketing hack that they use in their business... and some of these hacks are just unfair.
Email marketing is king.

If you're not already convinced, here are some crazy stats about email:

91% of consumers check their inbox daily. (ExactTarget)

Email is nearly 40X more effective than Facebook and Twitter for acquiring customers. (McKinsey & Company)

Companies using email to nurture leads generate 50% more sales-ready leads while generating them at 33% lower cost. (Forrester Research)

According to a 2016 study by eConsultancy, companies say that email marketing is their #1 channel for ROI, with 73% of respondents reporting a “Good” or “Excellent” return on their money.

So...

A few weeks ago, I emailed 100 of my favorite growth hackers and marketers online for their #1 email marketing hack that they use in their business. And they didn't disappoint.

Here are a few of the best email marketing hacks:

Try sending sales emails on Thursday night at 9PM Pacific. This pings our prospects when they are either in bed or getting ready for bed on the night before Friday: pay day. We’ve found that our prospects are 4x more likely to buy on Thursday night over any other night.

Here’s how you can easily increase your email open rates by 30%. I call it “Double Opens.” Step 1: Take an email you’ve already sent and change the subject line to something new. Step 2. Email it out a week later JUST TO YOUR NON OPENS. You might think you have a great email open rate – but the fact is, 50%+ of people are NOT opening your emails. With my first re-send, I got an extra 7,028 people to read my email, in just 1 minute of work.

My #1 email marketing tip is consistency. I’ve been managing 2 lists over the last few years, and one has got an email every single week without fail, while the other has been ad hoc. Once your audience stops getting used to hearing from you it has a big impact on your list. Make sure you have a process in place that sees your list getting regular great content without fail.
