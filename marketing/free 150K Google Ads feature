Google Analytics Feature Which Cost $150,000 Is Now Free
The feature to see individual user behaviour which was only available in Google Analytics 360 that costs $150,000 is now free. I shot a short video about what I think it's good for and how to turn it on.

And I would love to hear your opinion on this and how it can be useful.
