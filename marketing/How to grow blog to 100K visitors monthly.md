The Wiki Strategy: How to Grow Your Blog to 100k+ Monthly Visitors
Guide
I originally published this article on my personal blog in August, 2017. It generated so much interest that it laid the foundation for Growth Machine, so I've decided to republish it here.

 

In August 2015, I was hired to lead marketing and content for Sumo. At the time, their blog was getting ~5,000 visitors a month, mostly from a couple posts being sent to the email list. Over the next 8 months, I grew it to over 170,000 monthly visitors.

 

Since then, I’ve refined the core of the strategy I used there, and through Growth Machine, we've been helping other companies implement similar systems. Some have even beaten that growth rate, growing by tens of thousands of monthly visitors in just a few months.

 

But most blogs struggle to get over a few hundred visitors a day. And most companies that try blogging and content marketing as an acquisition strategy get nothing from it.

 

In almost every case, it’s because they’re focusing on the wrong things. Quantity over quality. Link building over question answering. Design over writing. Popups over value.

 

But a motivated content marketer in any niche can take a strategy like the ones I've come up with and apply it to their business and see massive success. Done properly, it can lead to tens or hundreds of thousands of new potential customers a month, arriving at your site naturally instead of by ads.

 

I’ve done it, I’ve trained people to do it, and with the right game plan, you can do it too.

 

My goal is to give you a game plan you could use for growing your own product’s blog. Think of this as the expanded, improved, and larger-scope version of my Growing a Site from 0-10k article. That one is three years old now and was good for a smaller, more personal blog. This article is for people who want to get serious about creating a content machine and making money from it.

 

I’ll start by outlining the core principles, then dive in more on how to properly do each of them.

Before I do, though, here’s how I’d recommend you use this guide.

Read through it once to get a general idea of the strategy.

Re-read the “Why You’ll Fail” section, and try to identify which errors you’re making.

Go back through the guide and implement each piece one at a time. This guide can be used to adjust an existing content strategy, or to build one from scratch. Once you understand the core principles, you can add in the pieces one at a time, and by the end of it, you’ll have a content machine that you can run with to dominate the information economy in your niche.
