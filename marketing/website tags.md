If you work in digital marketing and are not using Google Tag Manager, start today. I just saved dozens of agency hours
I just took on a web analytics audit for my firm and identified some serious gaps in engagement and conversion tracking. We don't have any in-house devs so I wasn't sure how long it would take for the digital agency we use to churn through the work much less if we'd have the budget for it. Then I discovered Google Tag Manager (I really don't know how I missed this for the past several years).

I've cleaned up our site's tags and implemented a dozen or so event tracking rules without much more than an intermediate understanding of HTML/CSS and a quick Lynda.com training course. I'm sure our agency would have estimated the work at around 30 hours, I got it done in about 12 hr spread over the last week.
