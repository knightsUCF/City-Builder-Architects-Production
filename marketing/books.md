Just finished 'Never Split the Difference' by Chris Voss. Brilliant book on negotiation and dealing with conflict. Would highly recommend to anyone, entrepreneur or no.

Also, 'Deep Work' by Cal Newport is an excellent read as well. Talks about the importance of deep focus and concentration on tasks/projects that will add the most value and get you ahead in an increasingly distracted, always-connected world.

The Hard Thing About Hard Things

Book by Ben Horowitz


Never Split the Difference – Chris Voss

The most important book on this list. It outlines and reinforces the fact that business, negotiation and any human interaction is inherently very emotional. It’s centered around negotiation but this book has so many solid management and leadership principles. Mirroring, tactical empathy, starting with no and labeling are all phenomenal.

The E-Myth Revisited – Michael Gerber

The first stop for any beginner. This is a great book about the importance of creating a business that can thrive without you. Preaches a lot of my favorite business principles like working on the things that are important for the long term but not necessarily urgent or pressing. Can be a little satire / elementary at times (the hotel description and Sarah’s “all about pies” are poor examples) for the more accomplished entrepreneurs but the principles are rock solid.

Entreleadership – Dave Ramsey

This book just has non stop quality advice about how to build a business the right way.  Dave doesn’t preach about politics or religion. He just tells it like it is and tells the stories of what worked for him. Phenomenal read.

Ego is the Enemy – Ryan Holiday

Ryan studies and preaches Stoicism and how to handle emotions, rejection and stress. Managing that split second between an event and your reaction is what life is all about. The Ego is the Enemy shows the incredible importance of remaining humble and the dangers of overconfidence and an inflated ego. I also recommend The Obstacle is the Way and The Daily Stoic by the same author.

Built to Sell – John Warrillow

This book talks about how to get your life back once your business takes over. How to specialize in your niche and do it really well. Make it scalable an take yourself out of the equation so that it is valuable to a potential buyer. Story format. Very good.

The Goal – Eliyahu Goldratt

Also in story format this is all about removing bottlenecks from your business. Find out what is holding you back and really focus on fixing that issue so you can break through and expand. The owner of the small business is almost always the bottleneck.

Company of One – Paul Jarvis

Large scalable companies aren’t likely and aren’t the goal of many entrepreneurs. Starting small and specializing is the key to building a great lifestyle business and then an asset that produces money while you live the life you want to be living. This book helps you question if growth is really the goal.

The Greatest Salesman in the World – Og Mandino

Life is all about being comfortable in uncomfortable situations. Everyone is a salesman and sales is uncomfortable. This book is a pump up about determination and perseverance and its importance. Its not always going to be fun. Its not always going to be easy.

2019 Small Business Taxes – JK Lasser

The best tax resource there is for small businesses. Reads like a text book but for some reason I absorbed it quickly and it was an enjoyable read. Explains all the important concepts around deductions and how to make sure Uncle Sam only gets what is actually his. A good accountant is critical but its even more critical that you understand this yourself.

High output Management – Andy Grove (founder of Intel)

More on the techy side of things but this book is a great way to think about building a business. A little older (1983 originally) but a look into the mind of one of the greatest entrepreneurs of all time. Everything is a process. Focus on data and other measurable variables. How to run meetings. How to make great decisions. Long term plans and short term objectives. And so much more.

Good to Great – Jim Collins

How so many companies get complacent and turn over in our economic lifecycle by failing to constantly improve and stay on the cutting edge. Its easy to stop looking at the big picture when you are winning. Then all of the sudden its too late.

The Lean Startup – Eric Ries

The business plan is just a hypothesis until you get out and prove it. Get out and interact with your customers and be ready to shift gears at a moments notice. As Steve Blank says “there are no 
So last year (2017), I read 100 books, 95% of them on marketing, business, or self-development (as related to business).

I found some gems, some that were NOT as good as advertised, and then some all-around cool, informative texts.

I chose the 100 books based on how many times I saw them recommended, customer ratings on Amazon, recommendations in other books, podcasts, etc. If you read all 100, you'll probably have a pretty good grasp on marketing by the end, haha.

Anyhow, I wanted to list my Top 10 here for ya. These 10 gave me the most insight, value, and were the most helpful in building my businesses.

The other 90 I'll link to after these:

(in no particular order):

1. Making Money is Killing Your Business - Chuck Blakeman

Follow along with this book and do exactly what he tells you. When you're done, you'll basically have a two-year, step-by-step plan for growing your business, you'll have more purpose for doing so, and you'll have an exit strategy in place.

2. Getting Everything You Can Out of All You've Got - Jay Abraham

Even though this was written in the early 2000s, this book is straight up foundational marketing strategy. A ton of my ideas for helping clients came from this book. It helped me think outside the box when coming up with marketing strategies, and to look for more untapped resources.

3. The One-Page Marketing Plan - Allan Dib

Developing a marketing plan can be daunting. In this book, the author breaks it down to where you have all aspects of a marketing strategy covered, and brief how-to's to develop each avenue. I found this one very helpful in preventing overwhelm.

4. Difference - Bernadette Jiwa

So many businesses struggle with developing sales copy & messaging that illustrates how they're different from their competition. This book was really helpful in assisting me with writing sales copy and marketing literature to help my businesses stand out.

5. Building a Story Brand - Donald Miller

This is another book that helps craft your sales message and company story. Donald Miller uses his take on the Hero's Journey to help you craft a compelling tale for your customers to get behind, and helps build brand loyalty.

6. The One Thing - Gary Keller

This is a pretty famous book by the guy who started Keller Williams Realty, and helps you come up with more of a purpose in your life and your business. It's a lot easier to work so hard on growing something when you have an uplifting, inspiring outcome that you're running towards.

7. Insight Selling- Michael Harris

This one was very helpful in teaching me to better sell my services. It shows you how to talk to clients in a way that resonates with them. Of course WE'RE all stoked about marketing, but not everyone shares our passion for this industry. Because of that, you have to learn how to talk to clients in a way that makes sense to them and provides them with "a-ha moments". This book helped me do that.

8. 7L: The Seven Levels of Communication - Michael Maher

This book is awesome for helping you develop a referral system. I learned over the past year how important building and implementing a referral system is, and this book will show you pretty much step-by-step how to do that.

9. Dotcom Secrets - Russell Brunson

I feel like Russell Brunson has really taken off in the last 18 months or so, & this book is one of the reasons why. RB is the godfather of sales funnels, and this book provides a lot of psychology and helpful scripts on building a successful sales funnel for an online business.

10. No B.S. Guide to Direct Marketing - Dan Kennedy Dan Kennedy is the godfather of direct response marketing. This book has not only a lot of strategies, but also a lot of tactics that you can use to help build your business and marketed better. There is a particularly cool case study about bringing in more revenue at a restaurant. I have used my take on this strategy with tons of clients recently.

All these books are so good at teaching you well-rounded business development and marketing. However, you HAVE to follow them and do what tell you to do! The problem that so many people run into is reading awesome books... but not taking action on what information they give you.

NOTE: If you're not much of a reader, then reading those first two will get you really, really far.

The Culture Code: The Secrets of Highly Successful Groups

The Best Team Wins: The New Science of High Performance


Start With Why by Simon Sinek should be number 1 on any list of marketing books imo.

Not a top 10 list my top 2 are probably: Start with Why, and The Zappos Experience.

 For the freelance copywriters I mentor, I start with John Caples' "Tested Advertising Methods", Bond Halbert's "The Halbert Copywriting Method Part III", Robert Bly's "The Copywriter's Handbook", and if you're a freelancer too, I strongly recommend Steven Slaunwhite's "Start and Run a Copywriting Business". Also check out Ogilvy's "On Advertising" and "Ca$hvertising" (although I'm not too fond of the latter). Be sure to read Cialdini's "Influence" if you're also interested in persuasion marketing and psychology. Anything in the field of behavioral economics is also golden. "Positioning" is worth checking out in general (it's been useful for copywriting, but especially consulting), but do take it with a grain of salt. I know I'm missing loads of good ones, but these should keep you busy. Do start with these before moving onto the classics like Eugene Schwartz and Claude Hopkins. Just my two cents.

Missing spin selling

Built To Sell

Duct Tape Marketing by John Jantsch is probably one of my personal favorites in the marketing category

On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors -Great insight to all facets of business. After I read it, was very interesting to see how often it was brought up in business school.

Iaccoca -Won't lie, I've got a thing for the auto industry. Another great look at how every department comes together to make a company successful

Let my people go surfing -Interesting look how Patagonia grew without sacrificing their values

Blue Water Strategy -Always look for where new opportunities are.
