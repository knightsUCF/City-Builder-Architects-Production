How I Grew My Instagram From 0 to 1000 Followers in 7 Days
Last night my Instagram, @sunrise_alarm, hit 1,000 followers.

One week ago, I started this page to market my iOS app Sunrise Alarm. My strategy with the Instagram page was to gather a specific demographic of followers interested in sunrises, by creating a feed of sunrise pictures, and then converting those followers to downloads.

Research I researched several sunrise pages with tens of thousands of followers. I noted the various “community accounts” handles and the hashtags that they require to be featured.

Content As everyone building an Instagram page knows, content is key. I found really great, royalty free sunrise photos from Pexels.com and Unsplash.

Captions I have a standard format that I save on the Notes app on my computer that is formatted like this: 1 line about the photo, 1 line CTA directing people to download my app using the link in my bio, 1 line credit for the photographer, 20 @tags for the community pages and their admins, and 30 hashtags including the community hashtags collected earlier from research as well as some of my own hashtags generated using the app Hashtag Expert.

Note: I tag people in the caption because after several posts of tagging 20 people in the photo, Instagram started removing the tags. I use the same set of tags and hashtags in every post.

Posting You have to post at least two to three times a day (morning afternoon and night) to keep your users engaged. It’s also difficult to post many times via the phone, so I started using a trick to post using Google Chrome. Open up chrome and while on the new tab screen, navigate to ‘View > Developer > Developer Tools’. On the left side click to toggle the ‘Device toolbar’. Select ‘iPhone 6’ at the top. Now navigate to Instagram.com and you will be able to post via Chrome.

Growth Once you have a couple of good quality posts on the account, go to those community pages, and start following people who follow those community pages, en masse. You should manually follow at least 200 or more per day. I found that at least 20% follow back.

While you’re building your following, stay engaged with your followers. Reply to comments, visit random followers’ profiles and leave likes and comments, etc.

Share Instagram stories encouraging users to tag you in their posts. Then, share their photos with credit. This helps to maintain engagement. For 1,000 followers, I typically get about 200 likes per post.

Tracking Growth The final step is tracking engagement and other KPIs. I don’t use Instagram’s analytics; instead I use the pro version of a third party app called Command which tracks followers/likes/etc. over time.

My plan is to ride this strategy out to about 10k, and then start posting legitimate advertisements for my app as photos on the account.
