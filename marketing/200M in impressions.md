$200 million in earned impressions...because Volvo couldn't afford a Super Bowl ad
Thought this was pretty damn impressive. In 2015, Volvo couldn't pony up for a Super Bowl ad, like their competitors would. So with some fancy marketing jujitsu, they turned their competitors' campaigns into a trigger for a social media campaign that earned $200 million in earned impressions and increased sales on their flagship SUV by 60% the next month.

Basically, they bought cheaper, pre-Super Bowl ads telling people that if they tweeted #VolvoContest and a friend's name during any other car commercial in the Super Bowl, their friend might win a car.

Great study on how external triggers (ala Nir Eyal) don't need to be your own.

I was so impressed, I interviewed the woman who made it happen for my podcast. The main points are all above so only follow through if you've got a real hankering to get the details on how they did it.
