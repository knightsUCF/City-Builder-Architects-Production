Made a website for finding the best Instagram hashtags given your account size (WhichHashtag.com)
Hi marketers,

This is the first website I've made so take it easy on me. It's called WhichHashtag.com . All of the hashtag sites that I've seen give you the most popular hashtags for keywords/categories. If your account only has a couple thousand followers, there is no chance of being seen on on hashtags like #fashion #art #dogs etc. It's better to use mostly hashtags that fit your account size with maybe a couple that are reach hashtags if you get super lucky. My background is in statistical modelling so I applied some of those approaches for a hashtag generator for top instagram hashtags given your account size.

My next goal is to have curated lists for different topics like fashion, art, memes, etc for different account sizes. So you can just copy/paste pre-made 30 hashtags lists. Check out the site and let me know!
