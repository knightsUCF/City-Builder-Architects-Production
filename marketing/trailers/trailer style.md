This one has a nice ending where they show the dates the game comes out at the end. Nice frames there.

Study other trailers.

Get a really good trailer ready before game launch. Advertise the trailer everywhere. Use hype to stir up interest.

This way we can use initial momentum to our advantage. This will go along with an entire plan.

Perhaps create a desktop version of the game, that streamers can get exclusively. Not sure if should do this.

But with an organized campaign like this could rise to the top of the charts.

Go through all those marketing books and take notes.

Best bet is streamers, so maybe the best use of time is just to spend days sending out press release kits to as many streamers as possible.

The obvious problem is that not every stream will want to mess around with streaming their mobile device. So perhaps create a desktop copy.

Once the game starts we could have a nice looking splash screen that tells when the game will be released.

Not sure about this. 

Perhaps the best solution is to offer the desktop game for $5, but without cosmetics and some features of mobile.

We need to avoid the Steam store because of their contract, which doesn't allow different pricing models.

Or perhaps we can use the same pricing model? Well, no, because we would have to give the game away for free, perhaps we could
charge cosmetic stuff in the game.

This would be the best solution because the free desktop game would get in everyone's hands. But how about the advertising?

Can we should ads on the desktop version, is that tacky? Well, even if tacky, that's an easy way to make money.

I mean even Warframe makes money with a free game. And the Warframe team was wondering for the longest time if they could 
make money, and they had many years of experience in the "industry". And Warframe is only out for Windows. This is still a relatively new thing, since there are not many free to play games like Warframe.

Just email Steam support and ask these questions, specifically the one about in game ads, and how this would compare to mobile.

Mention that want to release the game for free on both platforms.

Then the splash screen can say coming to desktop, MacOS, Linux, Windows, iOS, Android, iPad, and Android tablets.

And then offer the mobile game free with in app cosmetic purchases and gold, mostly for the multiplayer version maybe?

If this works for Fortnite, why not for this game? People punch in their credit cards on Fortnite. 

Will need to study the process over the desktop experience.

Zero pay to win mechanics will win a lot of positive reviews. Only do cosmetics and ads.


# Desktop Ads

So the key question is will Steam allow ads on mobile and not on desktop even though the prices of the app (free) will be the same?

If not have to indepently release PC game outside of Steam.

If Steam allows this, might be better to only offer cosmetic items in the desktop version, and cosmetic items and ads in the mobile version.
