My advice for you honestly it's to make sure that you up your minimum rate and focus on getting 5 to 10 quality testimonials from happy clients. These clients you can use any and every method possible. You could use Facebook ads and tap into existing demand as long as there is not too much competition in your area and also you should consider using more organic tools like LinkedIn and reaching out to them this way.

I would honestly advise against using Facebook ads in the beginning until you have a solid amount of testimonials and case studies what you can point to.

Perhaps put these on landing page as quotes
