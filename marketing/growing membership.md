How I Grew A Monthly Membership Site From 0 Subscribers to 1341 in Under 90 Days With The Help of YouTube Ads
Let me start by saying this will be a very lengthy post but I plan to be as transparent as possible and I encourage questions if you have any.

The site is a membership site that teaches people everything they should have learned about finance in high school.

It’s priced at $25 per month and we sell this through an automated webinar.

Now that we have that out the way, I’m going to share with you guys how we was able to scale so quickly. I stumbled upon YouTube Ads after running into a lady at a mastermind who had tons of success with the paid ads side of Youtube.

She told me that I could grab a list of competitors videos and pop my ad up in front of them. This unto itself seemed amazing so I decided to give it a try.

I took two ads that were getting us sales on Facebook and decided those were going to be the ones that I use on YouTube.

(Take note of this: On Facebook we were happy getting sales at a CPA of $90. This meant we would break even if these people stayed around for 4 months in which we were perfectly fine with. We also have a pretty good backend that can monetize them and shorten that timeframe.)

The ads that I was going to run were getting us webinar registrations on Facebook for on average $3 per registration.

So those were my baseline numbers that I ran with on YouTube.

I then gathered a list of videos from some very similar channels and competitors in the niche. I went looking for videos that were less than 2 years old and had on average over 100k views.

I came up with 138 videos to advertise on. I was happy with this amount because they were so targeted to the perfect audience that in my mind we couldn’t fail.

So we set those ads live bidding $0.10 cost per view (this means we would pay $0.10 every time someone watches 30 seconds of our video that shows up prior to the competitors video or clicks the Call to action button to land on the webinar registration page).

After 24 hours I came back to look and boy was I upset. I spent $100 with no registrations. We also got 2,000 views on our ads but no one took action.

So I went back to the drawing board. I ruled out the competitors videos until I figured out how YouTube worked.

I then decided that I’d try the same videos but this time just use keywords. So anytime someone searched for a video on YouTube using these specific keywords, our video would pop up right before the video player.

I let this one go live and after 24 hours we had a little success. $100 spend and 10 registrations. So that’s $10 per registration which was higher than Facebook but what mattered was sales.

I went back to look at our back office and 0 sales. That sucked but I wasn’t going to rule it out completely because I knew there was people that had success.

I then remembered watching a video talking about how you have to tell people where to actually click when you create youtube ads (Bottom left for desktop and top right on Mobile devices). Also you have to structure it in a way to grabs their attention within the first 5 seconds and then tell them how you can help them. That’s when I had my partner create two new videos for the ads. This took him about 2 days so I stopped the ads and let him film.

Once I got the videos I loaded them up and set them live on YouTube. After 24 hours we were getting webinar registrations for $2.50 on average and the sales…

Oh boy! We were getting sales for under the cost of the monthly subscription so we were profiting (Which was something we were never able to do on the front end with Facebook ads)

On top of that, during this same time period we added an upsell that allowed people to get a yearly subscription at a discount when they paid $149 right after their purchase. And for some reason the people on youtube were taking this at a 20% rate which allowed us to scale quickly! Ultimately, they were just paying for us to acquire more customers since our CPA dropped drastically.

All in all this campaign has been working amazingly well for us. I have since went back to targeting placements with the new videos and they have been crushing it after some optimization. YouTube also creates similar audiences for you, this means that I now have an audience of 2 million people that are similar to people that have watched a video from our channel.

These audiences are the best audiences that work for us and where we see most of our sales followed by keywords, placements and then affinity audiences.

I never thought that we would have this much success but my belief is that people are already on youtube watching videos. They are ultimately looking for an answer to their problem so when they type in the search box they are typing the problem they are looking to fix. When the results show up, they will click on the video that grabs their attention and as soon as that loads our targeted video shows up as an ad but it doesn’t look like an ad because we structure it in a way to give them a solution to their problem. On top of that, being that they are interested in solving their problem by watching a video on youtube, it’s easy for them to watch a 45 minute webinar that helps them.

The conversions rates on people that come from YouTube is 43% higher than those that come form any of our other traffic sources.

We are able to bring in 50 sales a day profitably from YouTube, which also allows us to bring in 50-70 sales with Facebook because now we can pay more to acquire a customer.

We are now on track to hit 10k customers by March of this year which would put us at 7 figures in annual revenue!

I really hope this was able to help you all see how amazing YouTube traffic can be.
