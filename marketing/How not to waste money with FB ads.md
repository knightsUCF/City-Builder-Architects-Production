A great way to waste money with FB ads.
I do a lot of FB ads 'audits'

One of the most common wastes of money I see comes from the placements.

It’s a section of the FB ad creation process that FB tries to get you to gloss over (by the cunning use of radio buttons with “auto - recommended”),

the reason for this is simple - there is limited advertising space on the news feed, so facebook wants to show your ads in the less saturated places so as to take more money.

However, 9 times out of 10, the news feed is going to be your most profitable placement, and 9 out of those 10 times, it’s going to be the mobile newsfeed.

Other tips:

Instagram ads are creeping up in terms of effectiveness, and getting comparable results for those businesses who have an audience there.

The audience network is often criticised, but can be a great source of traffic for TOF blog post readers (Top of funnel, when you’re just building an audience of people who don’t yet know/like/trust you).

The right hand column is rarely effective, though I’ve seen some good results for Ecommerce retargeting.

Do you have conversion data? Clicks might be cheaper on one placement compared to another, but if you’re trying to get sales/signups/conversions, then make sure to base your decision of that data.

If you have a big presence on one platform (FB/Insta) and not the other, then this will affect your results, but might not mean that one is ‘better’ for you.

TEST - all of this is theory, test for yourselves, and pay attention to the results.

Here are some Extracts from audits I’ve done for various businesses in the last few months to give some real examples:

Ecommerce - 
"Look at this current campaign - ‘XXXX-XXX’ [this was a straight sales campaign to a massive, cold audience]
£66 has brought in 3 sales on the mobile feed. another £40 has been spent on the desktop feed and Instagram without a single sale.”

Influencer (affiliate) - [this comment related to every campaign they ran, because they just found a format that 'worked' and stuck to it]
“You are currently only showing ads on the FB news feed, that’s possibly a good move but if you are going to try running 'traffic' ads [they were just boosting page posts, rather than using any other objective], I would also test them on Instagram, as I’ve been seeing comparable results, and clearly the audience overlap is there for you. “

Ecommerce - 
"Typically, this is an area that people waste money, but even though you’re using the recommended placements rather than just focussing on the mobile news feed - it doesn’t seem to be harming you. What I would say though, is that Instagram posts look different, so should be put together differently and run separately.” [they were running sales ads across multiple placements - the results were uncommonly well spread, but they hadn't altered the ads to fit the platform for Insta]

SEO services - 
"For most businesses, I wouldn’t recommend this [running traffic to blog posts on & mobile desktop] because the mobile news feed gets better results, but for you that’s not the case - you’re getting consistently cheaper clicks on desktop, so that could be an opportunity to zig when everyone else is zagging and just costs."

Driving Instructor Training - 
"Your recent ads have been just on the news feed, which is what I would almost always recommend (mobile news feed only usually), but actually your previous campaigns had some encouraging results from the audience network, so if you follow my strategy suggestion from above [his funnel was to put out content around the FAQ's he gets, then retarget them to an ebook he wrote about what it's like to be a driving instructor, then book a consult call via email], then I would test running content ads to the audience network to see if that holds up."

Ecommerce - 
"Definitely room to test here - you can see that desktop newsfeed ads are more expensive, but if they are still within your acceptable cost per sale then it doesn't matter” [this was an ecommerce brand selling high-end pet accessories, running straight sales ads]

B2B Saas -
"The mobile news feed is going to be your bread and butter here, and the numbers back that up” [sending people to blog posts in order to retarget with case studies]

Accountant - 
“Mobile news feed results are best here, just stick with that for this stage as you have done for most of these" [content around the typical pain points that businesses who do their own accounts experience]

Hope that's useful - stop wasting your money folks!
